There was no water in the tub and the shower was not\nturned on. He was found by a neighbor. [**Name (NI) **] EMS, he was moaning\nand there was \"tone in his left arm\" which may have been\nconsistent with posturing. He was taken to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] and\nhead\nCT was performed, revealing a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage\nextending from the lower midbrain into the hypothalamus,\nthalamus\nand basal ganglia on the right, with significant mass effect,\nintraventricular extension with casting of the right ventricle\nand some blood product in the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral\nventricle.\n [**Hospital1 18**] Neurosurgery was called and on review of imaging and\nreported exam- Mannitol 100gm and Decadron 10mg x1 was\nrecommended and given.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a\nNeurosurgical evaluation. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] discussed and offered\nsurgical intervention, but this was refused based on\nthe family's knowledge of his wishes to not prolong life if\nincapacitated. He also had signed a DNR/DNI order. He was clear\nthat he did not want to be dependent of disabled. The family\nasked to maintain his intubation while other family members\narrive from inside and outside [**State 350**]. They offered that\nhe is an organ donor.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\n- DIABETES TYPE II\n- HYPERLIPIDEMIA\n- GLAUCOMA\n- OSTEOARTHRITIS\n- CAROTID STENOSIS left 60-69%, rt 50\n- VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE\n- BACK PAIN\n\n\nFamily History:\nNC\n\nPhysical Exam:\nNo eye opening, pupils 2mm and minimally react. No corneal on\nleft, minimal corneal on right. Extensor posture with LUE, RUE\nattempts to localize, BLE withdraw to noxious stim. No gag, not\noverbreathing the vent. Tone increased in left arm, normal bulk.\nToes are downgoing bilaterally.\n\n\nPertinent Results:\nFINDINGS:  There is a large intraparenchymal basal ganglionic\nbased hemorrhage. It is multilobulated in nature and at its\ngreatest extent measures 6.5 x 5.3 cm.  This is causing mass\neffect and shift of the normally midline structures of\napproximately 1.1 cm at the level of the hemorrhage.  There is\nalso intraventricular extension into the ipsilateral and\ncontralateral lateral ventricles.  There is effacement\nof the ipsilateral frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nPt was admitted to the neurosurgery service and the ICU. The\norgan bank was contact[**Name (NI) **]. [**Name2 (NI) **] was extubated on [**10-24**] without\nincident and a morphine drip was started and titrated to\nrespiratory rate. He passed away on [**10-24**] at 12:55 p.m. The\nfamily declined a post morteum exam.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nNone\n\nDischarge Medications:\nNone\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nIntracranial hemorrhage\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nExpired\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nNone\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nNone\n\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2136-10-24**]"
