The patient was in her usual state\n   of health until Wednesday [**2-11**], when she developed black diarrhea,\n   occuring 5 times daily. The patient attributes the black color to her\n   iron supplements. Along with diarrhea, the patient also experienced 2\n   episodes of vomiting (clear, no blood or coffee grounds). The patient\n   also had fever to as high as 100.6 on Friday [**2-13**] and Saturday [**2-14**].\n   .\n   On Sunday [**2-15**], the patient became lightheaded when getting up from the\n   toilet and fell, hitting her head and right elbow. She presented to\n   [**Hospital1 1**] [**Location (un) 78**], where head and c-spine CT were negative. She developed\n   chest pain after admission, relieved with metoprolol and nitroglycerin.\n   She received 1 unit of RBCs for Hct 27, and became short of breath. She\n   was given 40mg IV lasix and diuresed 500cc. She ruled in for MI with\n   third set of troponins peaking at 0.26. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 1**]\n   for cardiac catheterization on 100% non-rebreather and a heparin gtt.\n   Of note, pt was guaiac positive on admission.\n   .\n   On arrival to [**Hospital1 1**], the patient was taken to the cardiac catherization\n   lab, where she was found to have severe 3-vessel disease and an\n   elevated LVEDP (see below for details). She was transferred to the CCU\n   on a non-rebreather for further management. In the CCU, the patient was\n   weaned to a non-rebreather. She reported that her breathing was\n   improved and had no other complaints.\n   .\n   On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep\n   venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cough, hemoptysis, or red\n   stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies\n   exertional buttock or calf pain. She denies sore throat, sinus\n   congestion, dysuria. She denies weakness, tingling, or numbness. All of\n   the other review of systems were negative.\n   .\n   Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain and lightheadedness\n   as above and two pillow orthopnea. No syncope.

She has Q-waves in leads 1,\n   V4-6 and an axis of 90 degrees.  There is no prior tracing to compare\n   to, but she does reportedly have a history of right bundle branch block\n   in the past.  No ischemic changes are seen.\n   .\n   TTE [**2161-2-16**] ([**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 78**]): The left atrium is normal in size. The left\n   atrial volume is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular\n   systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the posterobasal septum and\n   dyskinesis of the adjacent posterior wall. The aortic valve leaflets\n   are mildly thickened (?#). Mild to moderate ([**11-29**]+) aortic regurgitation\n   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe (4+)\n   mitral regurgitation is seen.\n   .\n   TTE [**2160-11-13**]: Mild left atrial enlargement, other chamber sizes are\n   within normal limits. Mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.\n   Left ventricular systolic function estimated 55-60%.  There are no wall\n   motion abnormalities seen.  The aortic valve is mildly calcified with\n   mild aortic insufficiency.  The mitral valve is mildly thickened with\n   moderate mitral regurgitation.  Trace tricuspid regurgitation is seen.\n   There is no evidence of pericardial effusion or intracardiac mass.\n   .\n   ETT: P-MIBI [**2160-11-13**]: No significant focal reversible perfusion defect\n   is seen.  There is decreased perfusion to the inferior wall during\n   stress, which does not improve with rest and is consistent with\n   diaphragmatic attenuation artifact or a small fixed defect.  At rest,\n   the left ventricular ejection fraction is 62%.  At pharmacologic\n   stress, the left ventricular ejection fraction is 63%, which is within\n   normal limits.  No significant regional wall motion abnormality is\n   seen.\n   1. No evidence of focal jeopardized myocardium as described above.\n   2.

A small\n   calcific density identified between the lamina of C4 and C5 appears to\n   be due to calcification in the ligamentum flavum.  Degenerative changes\n   of facet joints are identified.  Minimal anterolisthesis of C4 over C5\n   and C5 over C6 as well as C7 over T1.  There is no evidence of high\n   grade spinal stenosis seen.  The prevertebral soft tissue thickness\n   ismaintained.

Etiology unclear: cardiac vs. related to pt\ns PNA\n   vs. related to dysphagia. Also likely some anxiety component. Of note,\n   pt was started on long-acting nitrate yesterday in an effort to better\n   control her pain. Also, increased metprolol overnight.\n   - continue metoprolol\n   - increase imdur to 90 mg daily; consider giving dose at bedtime\n   because pt seems to develop her chest discomfort at night\n   - continue PRN ntg\n   - consider further GI evaluation for potential dysphagia (see below)\n   .\n   # Hypoxemia: Pt will on NC and intermittently requiring NRB. Her\n   hypoxemia likely multifactorial, related to mitral regurgitation (4+ on\n   recent echo) and pneumonia (CXR shows multifocal pneumonia).\n   - f/u pending blood cultures and send second set prior to antibiotics\n   - continue antibiotics for HAP: vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin (day\n   1 = [**2161-2-18**])\n   - treat heart failure/mitral regurgitation with diruesis and BP control\n   - wean O2 as tolerated\n   .\n   # Decreased Hematocrit: The patient had a 5 point drop in her\n   hematocrit overnight. The most likely etiology for this is GI bleeding,\n   in this patient with a history of guaiac positive stools (including a\n   large guaiac positive stool yesterday).\n   - transfuse 1 unit PRBCs now, f/u Hct after\n   - crossmatched for 2 additional units\n   - d/w pt her goals of care; consider GI consult\n   - decreased heparin SQ and ASA doses\n   - send additional stool sample for c.diff, considering patient\ns recent\n   diarrhea\n   .\n   # Dysphagia: Yesterday evening, pt reported episodes of food\ngetting\n   stuck\n in her throat and subsequent emesis of partially digested food.\n   She states that she has never mentioned this to her doctors in the\n   past. Of note, there is some thought that the pt\ns dysphagia could be\n   contributing to her chest discomfort at night.\n   - d/w GI\n   - consider further work-up while inpatient versus as an outpatient\n   .\n   # NSTEMI: Troponin peaked at 0.26. Cath shows 3-vessel disease. Poor\n   candidate for PCI given 3VD and history of GI bleeding. Patient does\n   not want CABG.\n   - ASA (decreased dose as above)\n   - no Plavix given guaiac positive stools\n   - continue statin, metoprolol, Imdur\n   - holding ACE for now; will consider adding if BP not control\n   .\n   # Acute on chronic mitral regurgitation/heart failure: Echo shows new\n   focal wall motion abnormalities and worsened MR, likely of ischemic\n   etiology. Endocarditis less likely given blood cultures negative to\n   date. Patient does not want valve surgery.\n   - BP control with beta blocker, amlodipine, and Imdur\n   - supplemental O2\n   - diurese with IV Lasix (goal negative 1-2 L)\n   - f/u pending blood cultures\n   .\n   # Chronic kidney disease: Creatinine reportedly at baseline.\n   - renally dose meds\n   - avoid nephrotoxins\n   - trend creatinine\n   .\n   # Polymyalgia rheumatica:\n   -continue prednisone at home dose\n   .\n   # Anxiety/Depression:\n   -continue nortriptaline and Zyprexa at home dose\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition:\n   Glycemic Control:  Comments: ISS\n   Lines:\n   20 Gauge - [**2161-2-18**] 02:30 PM\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT: SQ UF Heparin\n   Stress ulcer: PPI\n   VAP:\n   Comments:\n   Communication:  Comments:\n   Code status: DNR / DNI\n   Disposition:ICU\n   ------ Protected Section ------\n   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note\n   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the\n   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided.

Head CT was negative.\nPatient had several episodes of chest pain and SOB after\nadmission and was found with MI. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 1**]\non [**2161-2-16**] for cardiac catheterization on 100% non-rebreather.\nPatient found with CHF exacerbation, 4+MR, and reported LLL pna.\nWe were consulted to evaluate patient's oral and pharyngeal\nswallowing function and r/o aspiration while eating and drinking.\nRN reported patient stated she possibly \"aspirates\" frequently.\nPatient with reported difficulty with puree during breakfast this\nam, but tolerated a chicken parmesan [**Location (un) 644**] for lunch this pm\nwithout difficulty.\nWhen asked about aspiration and swallowing, patient denied any\nsymptoms of aspiration or overt difficulty swallowing foods and\nliquids. Patient did endorse a baseline cough throughout the day\nbut denied coughing during meals.\nPMH:\nHypertension\ndiastolic CHF\nChronic Kidney Disease (Baseline 1.5-1.7)\nRight BBB\nMRSA in nares\nAtrial Fibrillation\nGout\nCellulitus\nAnxiety\nPolymyalgia Rheumatica\nDiverticulitis\nPast Surgical History:\ns/p cholecystecomty/appendectomy\ns/p tonsillectomy\ns/p surgery for anal fissure\nEVALUATION:\nThe examination was performed while the patient was seated\nupright in the bed on the CCU. Patient with nasal cannula and NRB\nin place. Patient reported that she removed NRB for meals today\nwithout desats.\nCognition, language, speech, voice: Patient was awake, alert,\noriented, able to follow commands, and participate in PO trials.\nSpeech was fluent and voice wfl.\nTeeth: intact dentition\nSecretions: normal oral secretions\nORAL MOTOR EXAM:\nTongue protruded midline. Functional labial and lingual strength,\nROM, and buccal tone. Palatal elevation was symmetrical. Gag\ndeferred.\nSWALLOWING ASSESSMENT:\nPO trials included ice chips, thin liquids (straw/consecutive),\nbites of puree, and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] cracker. Oral phase was grossly wfl\nwithout oral residue remaining. Laryngeal elevation felt adequate\nto palpation. No overt change in vocal quality noted. Patient was\nnoted with one mild throat clear on thin liquids following\nconsecutive bites of puree. No further throat clearing or\ncoughing noted on thin liquids alone or following further solids.\nO2 sats remained stable at 95%/96%. Patient denied the sensation\nof food or liquid stuck in her throat or going down the wrong\nway.\nSUMMARY / IMPRESSION:\nMs. [**Known lastname 11595**] presented with one mild throat clear on a trial of thin\nliquids following consecutive bites of puree. No further overt\ns/sx of aspiration were observed at the bedside. Patient may\ncontinue her current diet of thin liquids and regular solids.\nPlease continue supervision and monitor swallowing safety. If\nthere are further concerns for aspiration on this diet, please\nreconsult and we will be happy to return. Please reconsult as\nindicated following possible OR.\nThis swallowing pattern correlates to a Functional Oral Intake\nScale (FOIS) rating of level 7 out of 7.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. Continue PO diet of thin liquids and regular solids.\n2. Pills may be taken whole with water as tolerated.\n3. Supervision during meals to monitor swallowing safety.\n4. Encourage patient to take her time during meals.\n5. Q8 oral care.\n6. If there are further concerns for aspiration on this diet,\nplease reconsult and we will be happy to return.\n7. Please reconsult as indicated following possible OR.\nThese recommendations were shared with the patient, nurse and\nmedical team.\n____________________________________\n[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 2027**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5161**], M.S., CCC-SLP\nPager #[**Numeric Identifier 5162**]\nFace time: 1350-1405\nTotal time: 45 minutes\n"

Etiology unclear: cardiac vs. related to pt\ns PNA\n   vs. related to dysphagia. Also likely some anxiety component. Of note,\n   pt was started on long-acting nitrate yesterday in an effort to better\n   control her pain. Also, increased metprolol overnight.\n   - continue metoprolol\n   - increase imdur to 90 mg daily; consider giving dose at bedtime\n   because pt seems to develop her chest discomfort at night\n   - continue PRN ntg\n   - consider further GI evaluation for potential dysphagia (see below)\n   .\n   # Hypoxemia: Pt will on NC and intermittently requiring NRB. Her\n   hypoxemia likely multifactorial, related to mitral regurgitation (4+ on\n   recent echo) and pneumonia (CXR shows multifocal pneumonia).\n   - f/u pending blood cultures and send second set prior to antibiotics\n   - continue antibiotics for HAP: vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin (day\n   1 = [**2161-2-18**])\n   - treat heart failure/mitral regurgitation with diruesis and BP control\n   - wean O2 as tolerated\n   .\n   # Decreased Hematocrit: The patient had a 5 point drop in her\n   hematocrit overnight. The most likely etiology for this is GI bleeding,\n   in this patient with a history of guaiac positive stools (including a\n   large guaiac positive stool yesterday).\n   - transfuse 1 unit PRBCs now, f/u Hct after\n   - crossmatched for 2 additional units\n   - d/w pt her goals of care; consider GI consult\n   - decreased heparin SQ and ASA doses\n   - send additional stool sample for c.diff, considering patient\ns recent\n   diarrhea\n   .\n   # Dysphagia: Yesterday evening, pt reported episodes of food\ngetting\n   stuck\n in her throat and subsequent emesis of partially digested food.\n   She states that she has never mentioned this to her doctors in the\n   past. Of note, there is some thought that the pt\ns dysphagia could be\n   contributing to her chest discomfort at night.\n   - d/w GI\n   - consider further work-up while inpatient versus as an outpatient\n   .\n   # NSTEMI: Troponin peaked at 0.26. Cath shows 3-vessel disease. Poor\n   candidate for PCI given 3VD and history of GI bleeding. Patient does\n   not want CABG.\n   - ASA (decreased dose as above)\n   - no Plavix given guaiac positive stools\n   - continue statin, metoprolol, Imdur\n   - holding ACE for now; will consider adding if BP not control\n   .\n   # Acute on chronic mitral regurgitation/heart failure: Echo shows new\n   focal wall motion abnormalities and worsened MR, likely of ischemic\n   etiology. Endocarditis less likely given blood cultures negative to\n   date. Patient does not want valve surgery.\n   - BP control with beta blocker, amlodipine, and Imdur\n   - supplemental O2\n   - diurese with IV Lasix (goal negative 1-2 L)\n   - f/u pending blood cultures\n   .\n   # Chronic kidney disease: Creatinine reportedly at baseline.\n   - renally dose meds\n   - avoid nephrotoxins\n   - trend creatinine\n   .\n   # Polymyalgia rheumatica:\n   -continue prednisone at home dose\n   .\n   # Anxiety/Depression:\n   -continue nortriptaline and Zyprexa at home dose\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition:\n   Glycemic Control:  ISS\n   Lines:\n   20 Gauge - [**2161-2-19**] 06:45 PM\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT: SQ UF Heparin\n   Stress ulcer: PPI\n   VAP:\n   Comments:\n   Communication:  Comments:\n   Code status: DNR / DNI\n   Disposition: ICU\n"

Etiology unclear: cardiac vs. related to pt\ns PNA\n   vs. related to dysphagia. Also likely some anxiety component. Of note,\n   pt was started on long-acting nitrate yesterday in an effort to better\n   control her pain. Also, increased metprolol overnight.\n   - continue metoprolol\n   - increase imdur to 90 mg daily; consider giving dose at bedtime\n   because pt seems to develop her chest discomfort at night\n   - continue PRN ntg\n   - consider further GI evaluation for potential dysphagia (see below)\n   .\n   # Hypoxemia: Pt will on NC and intermittently requiring NRB. Her\n   hypoxemia likely multifactorial, related to mitral regurgitation (4+ on\n   recent echo) and pneumonia (CXR shows multifocal pneumonia).\n   - f/u pending blood cultures and send second set prior to antibiotics\n   - continue antibiotics for HAP: vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin (day\n   1 = [**2161-2-18**])\n   - treat heart failure/mitral regurgitation with diruesis and BP control\n   - wean O2 as tolerated\n   .\n   # Decreased Hematocrit: The patient had a 5 point drop in her\n   hematocrit overnight. The most likely etiology for this is GI bleeding,\n   in this patient with a history of guaiac positive stools (including a\n   large guaiac positive stool yesterday).\n   - transfuse 1 unit PRBCs now, f/u Hct after\n   - crossmatched for 2 additional units\n   - d/w pt her goals of care; consider GI consult\n   - decreased heparin SQ and ASA doses\n   - send additional stool sample for c.diff, considering patient\ns recent\n   diarrhea\n   .\n   # Dysphagia: Yesterday evening, pt reported episodes of food\ngetting\n   stuck\n in her throat and subsequent emesis of partially digested food.\n   She states that she has never mentioned this to her doctors in the\n   past. Of note, there is some thought that the pt\ns dysphagia could be\n   contributing to her chest discomfort at night.\n   - d/w GI\n   - consider further work-up while inpatient versus as an outpatient\n   .\n   # NSTEMI: Troponin peaked at 0.26. Cath shows 3-vessel disease. Poor\n   candidate for PCI given 3VD and history of GI bleeding. Patient does\n   not want CABG.\n   - ASA (decreased dose as above)\n   - no Plavix given guaiac positive stools\n   - continue statin, metoprolol, Imdur\n   - holding ACE for now; will consider adding if BP not control\n   .\n   # Acute on chronic mitral regurgitation/heart failure: Echo shows new\n   focal wall motion abnormalities and worsened MR, likely of ischemic\n   etiology. Endocarditis less likely given blood cultures negative to\n   date. Patient does not want valve surgery.\n   - BP control with beta blocker, amlodipine, and Imdur\n   - supplemental O2\n   - diurese with IV Lasix (goal negative 1-2 L)\n   - f/u pending blood cultures\n   .\n   # Chronic kidney disease: Creatinine reportedly at baseline.\n   - renally dose meds\n   - avoid nephrotoxins\n   - trend creatinine\n   .\n   # Polymyalgia rheumatica:\n   -continue prednisone at home dose\n   .\n   # Anxiety/Depression:\n   -continue nortriptaline and Zyprexa at home dose\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition:\n   Glycemic Control:  Comments: ISS\n   Lines:\n   20 Gauge - [**2161-2-18**] 02:30 PM\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT: SQ UF Heparin\n   Stress ulcer: PPI\n   VAP:\n   Comments:\n   Communication:  Comments:\n   Code status: DNR / DNI\n   Disposition:ICU\n"

She received 1 unit of RBCs\nfor Hct 27, and became short of breath. She was given 40mg IV\nlasix and diuresed 500cc. She ruled in for MI with third set of\ntroponins peaking at 0.26. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for\ncardiac catheterization on 100% non-rebreather and a heparin\ngtt. Of note, pt was guaiac positive on admission.\n\nOn arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was taken to the cardiac\ncatherization lab, where she was found to have severe 3-vessel\ndisease and an elevated LVEDP (see below for details). She was\ntransferred to the CCU on a non-rebreather for further\nmanagement. In the CCU, the patient was weaned to a\nnon-rebreather.

In the right upper lobe as well as in the entire left\nlung, the interstitial markings are increased, there are patchy\nareas of opacities, that are ill-defined and distributed in a\nmainly peribronchial pattern. In addition, a small left basilar\natelectasis and a small left pleural effusion is seen. Overall,\nthe morphology and distribution of the changes suggests\nmultifocal pneumonia rather than pulmonary edema. No evidence of\nright basal changes, no evidence of right-sided pleural\neffusion.\n\nCXR ([**2161-2-20**]) - In comparison with study of [**2-18**], there has been\nplacement of left subclavian PICC line extends to the mid\nportion of the SVC. There has been some decrease in the\nbilateral patchy areas of opacification, most likely consistent\nwith improving pneumonia.\n\nCardiac Cath ([**2161-2-16**]) -\n1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system\ndemonstrated severe three vessel CAD. The LCx was the least\nstenosed and there was no obvious single culprit stenosis. The\nLMCA had distal calcification with a hazy 30% stenosis. The LAD\nwas heavily calcified with diffuse disease throughout with\nserial 60% stenoses just before a major D4 with a distal 85%\nstenosis and an 80% apical stenosis. There was a high D1,\nfunctionally a large septal branch which was patent. A large D2\nand D4 were also patent. The LCx was tortuous proximally with\nslow flow and mild diffuse disease in the AV groove LCx. OM\nbranch had a proximal 50% stenosis with a tortuous upper pole\nand mild diffuse disease in the lower pole. The distal AV groove\nLCx supplied collaterals to the distal RCA system. The RCA was\nheavily calcified with a 40% ostial stenosis without pressure\ndampening. There was proximal diffuse disease up to 75% and\ndistal diffuse disease before the RPDA up to 45%.  There was\nmoderate diffuse disease throughout the RPDA with severe diffuse\ndisease in the distal AV groove RCA supplying the RPLs with slow\nflow (? severe disease vs. competitive flow from collaterals).\nSeptal collaterals from the LAD fill the RPDA.\n2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated RA\npressure\nwith a mean RAP of 9 mmHg. There was severely elevated left\nsided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 29 mmHg. There was\nmoderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension with an SBP of\n160 mmHg. No cardiac index could be calculated as unable to\nfloat PWP catheter beyond RA.\n3. Modest hypoxemia (O2 sat 93% on 15L NRB mask) improved to 96%\nwith the addition of 2L via nasal cannula arguing against\nsignificant shunt physiology.\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:\n1. Severe three vessel CAD.\n2. Severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n85 yo F with HTN, Afib, dCHF, CKD, h/o guaiac-positive stools,\ntransferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for cardiac catheterization in the\nsetting of elevated cardiac enzymes, new focal wall motion\nabnormalities, and worsened MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] to have extensive 3-vessel\ndisease.\n\n# Coronary Artery Disease: Pt noted to have a troponin leak at\nan OSH, with peak of 0.26. Was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac\ncatheterization, which revealed three-vessel disease. Given\nthis, pt is a poor candidate for PCI. After much discussion, pt\ndecided that she would not want cardiac surgery. [**Hospital 49578**]\nmedical management was pursued. During her hospitalization, she\nexperienced episodes of chest discomfort, particularly at night.\nShe did not exhibit any ECG changes during these episodes. Her\nmetoprolol was uptitrated, and she was started on a long-acting\nnitrate for further antianginal activity. By the time of\ndischarge, she had been free of chest pain for several days.\n\n# Acute on Chronic Diastolic HF / Worsened Ritral Regurgitation:\nEcho at OSH showing new focal wall motion abnormalities and\nworsened MR, likely of ischemic etiology. On presentation, she\nwas thought to be hypervolemic. Metoprolol and amlodipine were\ntirated for optimum BP control / afterload reduction. The option\nof mitral valvular surgery was addressed, but the patient was\nnot interested in cardiac surgery. She was diuresed with bolus\nIV lasix, which was converted to PO lasix prior to discharge.\n\n# Pneumonia: CXR performed on [**2161-2-18**] was suspicious for\nmultifocal pneumonia. Pt was initially started on broad-spectrum\ncoverage with vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin. She was noted\nto spike a fever on the night of [**2161-2-18**]; however, she remained\nafebrile after that. She did also have a leukocytosis throughout\nher hospitalization, which was improving at the time of\ndischarge. On [**2161-2-20**], her antibiotics were narrowed to\nlevofloxacin, as she had no positive cultures and appeared\nimproved clinically. Of note, at the time of discharge, she did\ncontinue to have an oxygen requirement, which was likely\nmultifactorial in etiology (see below).\n\n# GI Bleeding: The patient was noted to have guaiac positive\nstools during her hospitalization. She did have one episode of a\nhematocrit drop, for which she received a unit of PRBCs. Her\nhematocrit remained stable after that. She also complained of\nsome episodes of dysphagia, with food getting \"stuck\" in her\nthroat. She states that this has been occuring for some time.\nShe was seen by GI for both of these issues. Further evaluation\nwith a barium swallow was recommended as an outpatient. Further\nwork-up of her GI bleeding should also be pursued as an\noutpatient. Of note, in the setting of this GI bleeding, her\naspirin dose was decreased and her PPI dose was increased.
