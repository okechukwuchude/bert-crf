Both renal arteries appear\n widely patent. Moderate vascular calcifications of the abdominal aorta are\n evident. Assessment of the large bowel prior to and after the administration\n of IV contrast demonstrates no areas of suspicious endoluminal contrast\n extravasation.\n\n CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  Bibasilar dependent changes,\n consistent with atelectasis, are present.  Bilateral breast implants are\n present.\n\n The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands, and spleen appear\n unremarkable.  Within the pancreas are two hypodense lesions, one at the neck\n just anterior to the SMV measuring approximately 6 x 14 mm, and the other in\n the pancreatic tail measuring approximately 5 mm, both of which are hypodense\n and probably fluid attenuation.  There is no significant abdominal free fluid\n or adenopathy.\n\n CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  Uterus and adnexal structures\n and large and small bowel loops appear grossly unremarkable.  As noted\n previously, there is no overt contrast extravasation within large bowel loops.\n Bladder is within normal limits.  No pelvic free fluid or lymphadenopathy.\n\n Examination of osseous structures does not show lytic or sclerotic lesions of\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2186-7-26**] 3:50 AM\n CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS; CTA PELVIS W&W/O C & RECONS           Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 81718**]\n Reason: CT-A for lower GI bleed to plan angiography for embolization\n Admitting Diagnosis: BRIGHT RED BLOOD PER RECTUM\n Field of view: 40 Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 150\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n concern for malignancy.\n\n Degenerative changes at the disc space of L5-S1 are noted with loss of disc\n space and some vacuum phenomenon.  Mild disc space narrowing is also seen at\n the lower thoracic levels.\n\n 3D MIP and VR images created in the advanced imaging lab were used to assess\n vascular structures.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n 1.  No CT evidence of active endoluminal contrast extravasation within the\n large bowel.\n\n 2.  Low-density foci within the pancreas, consistent with cystic foci.\n Differential of these include pancreatic cysts, pseudocysts, IPMN.  Given the\n lack of enhancement on these images, these cystic lesions are likely to be\n benign, but suggest MRCP in [**6-3**] monthsfor assessment of stability and for\n further characterization.\n\n"

She was aggressively volume\nresuscitated with 5 L of crystalloid and transfused 2 units of\nPRBCs after continuning to pass dilute blood with a Golytely\nprep, which was then held the first night of the hospitalization\nafter completing half of the prep. On hospital day 2, she\nunderwent colonoscopy, which was remarkable for bleeding in the\ncecum, the site of 2 of her polypectomies 9 days prior to\nadmission; 4 clips were placed with adequate hemostasis. Her\nvolume and hematocrit subsequently remained stable. She was\ndischarged home in stable condition.\n\n# Tender hepatomegaly: The patient's liver was slightly tender\nto palpation on admission, which prompted and abdominal\nultrasound, which subsequently showed that the liver was normal.\n\n# Pancreatic cyst on US: On abdominal ultrasound a pancreatic\ncyst was found incidentally described as a 1.3 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm\npredominantly hypoechoic lesion in the pancreatic head/neck; it\nis likely benign. This will be further evaluated on an\noutpatient basis after discharge with an MRCP.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n- Simvastatin 60mg PO HS\n- HCTZ 12.5mg PO HS\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. Simvastatin 20 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO at bedtime.\nTablet(s)\n2. STOPPED: Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg Capsule Sig: One (1)\nCapsule PO once a day: Take in mornings; Restart in a week\n\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nHome\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nLower GI bleed from cecal polypectomy site\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nIt was a privilege to take care of you in the hospital.\n.\nYou were hospitalized for a bleed in your colon caused by the\nre-bleeding of one of your polypectomy sites in your cecum. You\nwere admitted to the ICU with a low blood count and low blood\npressures when sitting up and standing. We resuscitated your\nvolume and blood coutns with IV fluids and 2 units of packed red\nblood cells. A CT of yoru abdomen did not show the bleeding\nsource, but a colonoscopy revealed the source, which was stopped\nwith clips. You also underwent an abdominal ultrasound because\nyour liver was slightly tender on admission, which showed a\nnormal liver but an incidental finding of a pancreatic cyst. We\nrecommend that you have this finding evaluated further as an\noutpatient.\n.\nNo changes were made to your home medications.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nPlease schedule an appointment with Gastroenterology for\nevaluation of your pancreas\n\n\n\n"
