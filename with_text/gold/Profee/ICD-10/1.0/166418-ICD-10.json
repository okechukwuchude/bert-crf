I agree with the\n   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and\n   add the following points:\n   She has received 5 L NS so far and SBP( 150\ns) and HR( 120\ns) have\n   improved. She still has poor skin turgor but is febrile ( >101) and has\n   features of asymmetric edema in right LE. She is nonverbal. Chronic\n   skin changes noted and I cannot appreciate flank tenderness.\n   Elevated Hct, BUN/Creatinine, lactate and Sodium all concerning for\n   profound hypovolemia. She is on Vanco/ Cefepime at this time.\n   Agree with plan to rescucitate with IVF\ns ( switch to D51/2NS pending\n   repeat labs) and await cultures. She will need RLE exam to r/o DVT. Her\n   son [**Name (NI) **] has been updated and is having a tough time with his mother\n   health/ care and decision not to re-hospitalize in the context of her\n   overall health decline. Palliative care consult will be useful again.\n   Remainder of plan as outlined above.\n   Patient is critically ill\n   Total time: 50 min\n   _________\n   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3093**] [**Name8 (MD) **],  MD\n   Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine\n   [**Hospital1 5791**]\n   [**Location (un) 5176**], KS-B23\n   [**Location (un) 23**], [**Numeric Identifier 960**]\n   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 3093**] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD\n   on:[**2161-3-10**] 04:05 ------\n"
