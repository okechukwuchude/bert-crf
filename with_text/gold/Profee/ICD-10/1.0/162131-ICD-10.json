Presyncope/NSVT:  Pt had pacer evaluated by EP, which showed\na few episodes of NSVT which seem to correlate temporally with\nhis symptoms.  Also with runs of ventricular bigeminy with 1st\nQRS complex paced and second complex a wide complex PVC, other\nstrips show bigeminy without pacing.  Runs of sinus rhythm with\njunctional vs ventricular escape beats are also seen.  Patient\nwas followed closely by the EP service.  Possible etiology of\nNSVT could be due to hypokalemia.  Patient had potassium\naggressively repleted.  Prior to discharge, his potassium level\nwas 4.2, for which he was repleted with an extra 40 mEq of\npotassium for goal of 4.5.  Patient was continued on\ndronedarone.  Metoprolol was stopped.  Lisinopril decreased to 5\nmg daily.  Patient will also start daily potassium\nsupplementation.  He will follow up closely in device clinic\nwhere he will have repeat CBC, lytes, and INR checked.\n.\n#. Failure to thrive: patient has had recent weight loss,\ndecrease in appetite, overall fatigue and malaise.  Sinamet is\nthe most recent addition to his outpatient medications.  His\nneurologist did not think that these symptoms are due to\nsinamet, although sinamet may cause some nausea, the treatment\nof which would be to take an extra 25mg of carbidopa along with\nhis sinamet.  This was discussed with patient and a prescription\nfor carbidopa was provided to be taken as needed for nausea.\n.\n#. Pancytopenia: the etiology of this is unclear.  His\nmedications were reviewed with no offending medications found.\nHis neurologist did not think that this was being caused by any\nof his parkinson's meds.  He will have a repeat CBC drawn on his\nnext visit at device clinic to follow up.\n.\n#. Acute renal failure - patient on admission had creatinine of\n1.3 which trended down to baseline of 1.0 with gentle IV fluids.\n.\n#. Supratherapeutic INR - patient's albumin was normal which\nsuggests not a synthetic problem.  LFT's also normal.  Patient\nhad warfarin held during this admission, but on discharge his\nINR was back within therapeutic range of 2.0-3.0 at 2.9.  He\nwill be restarted on warfarin as an outpatient, and will have\nINR checked on his next visit to device clinic for further\nmanagement of his warfarin dosing.\n.\n#. Parkinson's - patient was continued on sinamet and azilect\n\nMedications on Admission:\nWarfarin 1 mg or 5 mg daily (? med list unclear)\nMetoprolol tartrate 50mg PO bid\nLisinopril 5mg po daily  (vs 20mg daily by medication list)\nDronedarone 400mg po BID\nAzilect (Rasagiline) 1mg daily\nCarbidopa/Levodopa 25/100 tid\nFlomax 0.4mg qhs\nAmbien 10 mg qhs prn\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

You were admitted to the cardiac intensive\ncare unit for close monitoring.  The electrophysiology service\nevaluated you on this admission and changed some of the setting\non your pacemaker.  They found brief episodes of abnormal rhythm\nwhen they interrogated your pacemaker.  You will need to\ncontinue taking dronedarone.\n\nWe contact[**Name (NI) **] your neurologist in regards to your parkinson's\nmedications: sinemet and resegaline.  It does not appear that\nthey are the causes of your appetite or weight loss.  Sinemet\ncan cause nausea, and the treatment to that is to take an\nadditional 25mg of carbidopa along with the sinemet\n\nYou will also need to continue warfarin.  Your INR on discharge\nis 2.9.  Please continue to have your INR checked periodically\nin order to manage your warfarin dosage.\n\nYou will need to have your labs checked again.
