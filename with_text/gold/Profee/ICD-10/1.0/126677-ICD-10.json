Normal interatrial septum.\nNo ASD by 2D or color Doppler.\n\nLEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Mildly dilated LV cavity. Severely\ndepressed LVEF. No LV mass/thrombus. No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.\n\nRIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity. Severe global RV free wall hypokinesis.\n\nAORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels.\n\nAORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.\n\nMITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. No MS. Trivial\nMR.\n\nTRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. No TS. Mild [1+]\nTR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.\n\nPULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS.\n\nPERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.\n\nConclusions:\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or\ncolor Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left\nventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic\nfunction is severely depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %) with global hypokinesis and\ndistal LV/apical akinesis to dyskinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the\nleft ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular\ncavity is dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of\naorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve\nleaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.\nThere is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The\ntricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery\nsystolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\n\n"

If the\nulcer probes the bone this would be highly suspicious for\nosteomyelitis.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nPrimary Reason for Hospitalization:\n57M w/ HTN, DM, HLD, PVD and ESRD on HD presented to OSH with\ninferior STEMI s/p PCI to RCA now transfered for further care.\n\nActive Issues:\n# Cardiogenic Shock: Patient required pressor support with\ndopamine following PCI at OSH and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] at a\ndose of 8mg/kg/min.  On HD6 patient was successfully weaned from\ndopamine and was maintaining a stable blood pressure.  He\nmaintained pressures through dialysis as well.  He was restarted\non his home anti-hypertensives prior to discharge.\n\n# CAD:  Patient did not have prior history of known CAD, but\nrecent TTE from [**5-/2158**] revealed anterolateral and apical defects\nconsistent with CAD. Patient presented on [**8-1**] with RCA infarct\nthat required BMS x3. Cardiac cath also revealed 90% LCx disease\nand completely occluded LAD that was presumed chronic. LV gram\nrevealed LVEF of 20%.  On HD3 patient was taken to the cath lab\nand had successful stenting of his left circumflex.  He was\ncontinued on plavix and aspirin throughout admission.\n\n# ESRD on HD: Patient receives chronic HD on MWF schedule.\nPatient's electrolytes were monitored closely throughout\nadmission.  Patient was dialyzed on his normal schedule and\npressures tolerated this without issue.  He refused many of his\nmedications throughout admission.\n\n#Bacteremia: Patient had one blood culture positive for gram\npositive cocci, MSSA.  He was treated with IV vancomycin given\npenicillin allergy.  Patient will be treated for 10 day course,\nlast day [**2158-8-15**].  A PICC line was placed for IV administration\nfollowing discharge.  Patient was afebrile and hemodynamically\nstable at the time of discharge.  He had two days of\nsurveillance cultures with no growth to date at the time of\ndischarge.\n\n#Atrial fibrillation: Patient had an episode of atrial\nfibrillation during his catheterization.  He was given\namiodarone, and spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm.  He\nagain had an episode of atrial fibrillation on HD5 and was\nstarted on an amiodarone drip.  He spontaneously converted into\nsinus rhythm again, later the same day.  He was started on oral\namiodarone with a goal loading dose of 8g.  At the time of\ndischarge, his dose was 300mg po BID.  He will continue this for\n11 days, ending [**2158-8-21**].  At that time, he should be\ntransitioned to amiodarone 200mg po daily.  Despite CHADS2 score\nof 3, patient was felt to be a poor candidate for\nanticoagulation given poor medication compliance and fall risk.\nPatient was in sinus rhythm and hemodynamically stable at the\ntime of discharge.\n\n# HTN: Patient was in cardiogenic shock at the time of\nadmission, therefore his home anti-hypertensives were held.\nSince BPs were still lowish at discharge norvasc was\ndiscontinued and valsartan was continued but at a much lower\ndose (40mg [**Hospital1 **]).\n\n# HLD: Patient is s/p STEMI. He was changed to 40mg po\natorvastatin daily as he is also on amiodarone, and therefore\nwas felt to not necessitate 80mg daily.\n\n# Right heel ulcer: Patient had a 2x4 cm ulcer on right heel\nconsistent with arterial insufficiency. Per report, this has\nbeen followed by vascular surgery as an outpatient.  Patient was\nevaluated by both vascular surgery and podiatry.  Both teams\nagreed that the ulcer was not actively infected, and therefore\nthere was no indication for antibiotics.  The ulcer was cleaned\ndaily with application of Santil ointment.  An xray of the heel\nwas performed showing an ulcer but no cortical destruction.  Per\nvascular surgery, the patient should have an ABI checked as an\noutpatient.\n\n# Bilateral hearing loss: Patient reported acute hearing deficit\ncoinciding with his myocardial infarction. No obstructive cause\nwas apparent on otoscopic examination. Hearing loss appeared to\nbe symmetric. He was not given otoxic drugs. Ischemia in the\nsetting of cardiogenic shock is also a possiblity. Symptoms were\nnot consistent with CVA causing hearing loss, as he had no\nassociated symptoms of nystagmus, nausea or dizziness as would\nbe expected.  Patient's hearing improved spontaneously.  He\nshould have ENT follow-up as an outpatient if he continues to\nhave further issues.\n\n# Compliance: Patient refused many medications throughout\nadmission, which made regulation of blood sugar and electrolytes\ndifficult.  He was made aware of the risks involved in refusing\neach medication.\n\nChronic Issues:\n# DM: Patient is on oral hypoglycemics and insulin at home.\nPatient's blood sugars were controlled throughout admission on a\ndiabetic diet and insulin sliding scale.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n- Patient maintained full code status throughout hospitalization\n- Patient will need ABIs performed as outpatient.  Dressing\nchanges daily to heel.

You were admitted to our hospital because\nfollowing heart your catheterization because you required IV\nmedications to maintain your blood pressure.  During this\nhospitalization, a previously noted blockage in your coronary\narteries was stented open.  After this, the IV medications were\nslowly weaned and your blood pressure was stable off of these\nmedications at the time of discharge.\n\nYou were dialyzed on your normal schedule throughout admission.\n\nIn addition, you had an infection in your blood stream. One of\nyour blood cultures grew a bacteria called Staph Aureus. We\ntreated this with an IV antibiotic (vancomycin) as you are\nallergic to penicillin.  You will need to continue this\nmedication through [**2158-8-15**].\n\nMedication changes:\nYou were continued on most of your home medications. But you\nshould STOP the following home medications:\n1. Norvasc\nThe following home medications had their doses changed:\n1. Diovan dose decreased from 160mg [**Hospital1 **] to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]\nYou were started on the following NEW medications.  These\nmedications are very important.  Please be sure to take them\nevery day as prescribed.\n   1.  Plavix 75 mg by mouth once each day\n   2.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once each day\n   3.

On\n[**2158-8-23**] you will change this does to 200mg by mouth once each\nday and continue this indefinitely.\n   6.  Vancomycin IV with dialysis each time dialyzed, ending\n[**2158-8-15**]. After you finish this medication your PICC line can be\nsafely removed.\n\nWeigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more\nthan 3 lbs.\n\n\n"
