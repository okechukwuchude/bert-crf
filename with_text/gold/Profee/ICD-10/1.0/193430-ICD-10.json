Normal appearing bowel.\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n INDICATION:  85-year-old female presenting with chest pain and abdominal pain\n radiating to the back, with nausea and vomiting since yesterday.  There is a\n concern for abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n\n No comparison studies available.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired 5-mm axial images of the abdomen were obtained\n before and following the uneventful administration of 100 cc of Optiray\n intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformats were performed at 5-mm\n slice thickness.\n\n FINDINGS:\n\n CTA:\n There are mild atherosclerotic calcifications throughout the abdominal aorta,\n which demonstrates normal caliber and patency throughout its course.  Moderate\n atherosclerotic calcifications are seen within the iliac branches, with no\n evidence of significant stenosis.  On primary image reconstructions there was\n suggestion of a 7-mm aneurysm at the celiac artery near the takeoff of the\n left gastric and common hepatic arteries (5:32), but on 3D reformations and\n volume renderings (series 450-452), this appears to be an ectatic rather than\n an aneurysmal segment.  The SMA is widely patent and normal in caliber,\n demonstrating multiple segmental and subsegmental branches which opacify with\n contrast.  The [**Female First Name (un) 85**] is patent.  A small left accessory renal artery is seen\n (5:43).  A small atherosclerotic plaque rises from the takeoff of the right\n main renal artery (5:39), however, patent distal flow is seen and the kidneys\n appear to enhance symmetrically.\n\n ABDOMEN:\n Included views of the lungs demonstrate mild dependent atelectasis.  The heart\n size is normal.  There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.  Lipomatosis of\n the interatrial septum is present (2:1).  There are mild atherosclerotic\n calcifications of the coronary vessels and aortic valve.\n\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2151-11-27**] 12:26 PM\n CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS; CTA PELVIS W&W/O C & RECONS           Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 87372**]\n Reason: r/o aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection, colitis\n  Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 100\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n The liver, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, pancreas, stomach, and\n intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel are within normal limits.\n Scattered prominent mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes do not meet CT\n criteria for lymphadenopathy.  There is no free air or free fluid.\n\n PELVIS:\n The rectum appears normal.  There is moderate colonic diverticulosis, with no\n evidence of diverticulitis.  The uterus appears normal, containing a coarse\n calcification (5:124) which is most compatible with a fibroid.  No adnexal\n masses are detected.  There is a small amount of pelvic free fluid (5:119).  A\n pessary device is appropriately postioned (5:136).  A Foley catheter\n terminates appropriately within a partially collapsed bladder.  There is no\n intrapelvic lymphadenopathy.\n\n OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:\n There is no acute fracture or dislocation.  No concerning blastic or lytic\n lesions are identified.  Mild multilevel degenerative changes are present\n throughout the thoracic and lumbar spine, including mild multilevel facet\n arthropathy from L3 through L5.\n\n 3D reformations were created in the Imaging Lab to support these findings.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n 1.  No AAA or acute aortic process.\n 2.  Ectatic celiac axis origin without discrete aneurysm.\n 3.  No acute intra-abdominal process seen.\n\n"

Her thiazide diuretic\nwas held, as this was likely contributing to hyponatremia.  On\nadmission, she was noted to be hypovolemic and her sodium\nimproved some with normal saline.  However, her sodium started\nto decrease with continued normal saline infusion.  Urine and\nserum lytes were rechecked and in the setting of euvolemia, her\nhyponatremia was thought most likely to be due to SIADH (urine\nosm >400, serum Na <120 and serum osms low, and urine Na\ninappropriately high).  CT head and chest were done to eval for\nmalignancy for etiology of SIADH, no masses were noted.  She was\ntreated with free water restriction and TID salt tabs, as\nrecommended by the nephrology service.  On discharge she will\ncontinue to take salt tabs and have her Na monitored as an\noutpatient.  Na on discharge 132.  She will f/u with PCP for\nanother [**Name9 (PRE) **] check on [**12-7**].  She should probably not restart a\nthiazide diuretic in the future.\n\n#Altered mental status: likely has baseline dementia that\ninitially was slowly progressing but acutely worsened after\nbeing hospitalized in [**Month (only) **].  Has 24 hr nursing care at home.\n During admission initially, was frequently not oriented to\nplace or location, or why she was in the hospital and often saw\npeople and things that were not actually present, with both\nauditory and visual hallucinations.  Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] course\nsuggested delirium in the setting of her hyponatremia vs\nworsening dementia.  On discharge, mental status at baseline per\nfamily, unable to do months of the year backwards but AOx3 and\nno hallucinations.  continued home aricept.\n\n# HTN: Her hydrochlorothiazide was held as above.  She was\ncontinued on valsartan at 160 mg [**Hospital1 **], which is her home dose.\nShe was also continued on isosorbide mononitrate.  SBP was still\nelevated to 140s-160s, so amlodipine 5 mg daliy was started for\nimproved BP control.\n\n# ?Celiac aneurysm: Initially CT Abd/pelvis showed concern for\nceliac artery aneursym, however final CTA read ectatic celiac\nartery without aneurysm.\n\n# Elevated lipase: Unclear significance with no radiographic\nevidence of pancreatic and benign abdominal exam.  Also had CTA\nabd/pelvis without evidence of pancreatitis.\n\n# CAD s/p PCI: She was continued on ASA, valsartan, and\nclopidogrel.\n\n# DM 2: HISS with accuchecks, continued home metformin on\ndischarge.\n\n# HLD: Vytorin continued on discharge.\n\nCode: DNR/DNI (confirmed with daughters/[**Name2 (NI) **]-HCPs during admission\n\nContact: [**Name (NI) 107386**],[**First Name3 (LF) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 107387**]\n\nMedications on Admission:\nClonidine 0.15 mg po bid\nASA 325 mg daily\nMVI\nxalatan eye drops\nValsartan 320 mg daily\nClopidogrel 75 mg daily\nVytorin daily\nCa/Vit D\nOmeprazole\nAricept 10 mg daily\nMOM\nFosamax 35 mg weekly\nMetformin 850 mg po bid\nHCTZ 25 mg daily\nImdur 60 mg daily\nSL NTG PRN\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
