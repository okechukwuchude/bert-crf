Abdomen is\n tense.  Evaluate for possible cause of sepsis.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images were acquired from the lung bases through the\n lesser trochanters following the administration of oral contrast only.\n Multiplanar reformations were performed.\n\n COMPARISON:  Pelvis radiograph from [**2180-11-14**].\n\n ABDOMEN CT:  Aside from minimal bibasilar atelectasis, the visualized portions\n of the lungs are clear.  There may be trace bilateral pleural effusions.\n Relative hypodensity of the intraventricular blood compared to the myocardium\n is consistent with anemia.  Coronary artery calcifications are seen.  There is\n no pericardial effusion.\n\n Lack of intravenous contrast material limits assessment of the abdominal\n organs.  The liver is within normal limits.

The spleen is otherwise grossly\n normal.  Scattered pancreatic calcifications are noted.  The pancreas is\n otherwise grossly unremarkable.  The adrenal glands are within normal limits.\n There are bilateral extrarenal pelvises.  There is no hydronephrosis.  No\n renal calculi are identified.  Tiny left renal hypodensities are too small to\n characterize but are statistically simple cysts.  The stomach is collapsed and\n not well evaluated.  There is a small hiatal hernia.  The small bowel and\n colon are unremarkable.  The appendix is not well visualized.  There is no\n free fluid or free air in the abdomen.  No pathologically enlarged abdominal\n lymph nodes are seen.  The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber.  Aortic and\n [**Hospital1 **]-iliac artery calcifications are seen.\n\n PELVIS CT:  A Foley catheter is seen within the bladder, which is otherwise\n unremarkable.  The uterus is unremarkable.  There is no free fluid in the\n pelvis.  No pathologically enlarged pelvic lymph nodes are seen.\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2183-3-17**] 6:48 PM\n CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST                                    Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 82322**]\n Reason: Please evaluate for possible causes for sepsis\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n\n BONE WINDOW:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.\n Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine are seen, most\n severe at L4-5 and L5-S1.  There is a grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5 on S1.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n 1.  No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic process.\n\n 2.  Incompletely characterized 15 x 11 mm splenic hypodensity.  In the absence\n of a history of malignancy, incidental splenic lesions are typically benign.\n\n 3.  Pancreatic calcifications, some may be vascular, but raising concern for\n chronic pancreatitis.

In\nthe absence of a history of malignancy, incidental splenic\nlesions are typically benign.\n\n3. Pancreatic calcifications, some may be vascular, but raising\nconcern for chronic pancreatitis.

Patient was\nstarted on vancomycin and cefepime.  She was switched to\nbactrim/doxycycline PO. Her blood pressure was low on night of\nadmission and received a total of 8 liters of IVFs over\napproximately 16 hours. Her blood pressure then normalized after\nthis intervention. Patient was called out of the MICU within 24\nhours of admission. On arrival to the medicine floor, patient's\nantibiotics were switched to augmentin/bactrim for cellulitis\nand azithromycin for questionable atypical pneumonia.  Knowing\nthat patient had recent urinary tract infection, urine culture\nresults were obtained form [**Doctor First Name 1191**] which showed sensitivity to\nnitrofurantoin, which patient had been treated with prior to\nadmission. AVSS throughout stay on medicine floor.\nHer rash was not classic for cellulitis given the\nvesiculo-pustular appearance and symmetry; it appeared more like\na contact dermatitis, although without known exposure. We\nunroofed a vesicle and sent for HSV/VZV DFA which is pending at\ntime of discharge. Also would consider medium potency topical\nsteroid cream.\nPatient will be continued on augmentin/bactrim x 5 more days and\nazithromycin x 3 more days.\n.\nGoals of Care: ICU attending held discussion with HCP regarding\ngoals of care and it was decided that patient would not benefit\nfrom escalation of care.  This included NO central line or\npressors.  Patient would likely benefit from DNH (do not\nhospitalize) order.\n.\n[**Last Name (un) **]: Elevated at 1.7 from baseline near 1.0.

No transfusions in the MICU.
