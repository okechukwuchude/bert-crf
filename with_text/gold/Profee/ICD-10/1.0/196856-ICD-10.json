The left main and intrarenal arteries\ncould not be adequately interrogated. An MRI may be obtained for\nfurther evaluation if clinically necessary.\n\n[**2-14**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right\natrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left\nventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is\nnormal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).\nRight ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.\nThe ascending aorta is mildly dilated.

Moderate symmetric\nleft ventricular hypertrophy with mild global systolic\ndysfunction. Mild pulmonary hypertension. These findings are\nmost consistent with hypertensive heart disease.\n\n[**2-15**] MRI abdomen: There are bilateral solitary renal arteries\nwithout stenosis with conventional branching. The kidneys\ndemonstrate normal size, morphology and signal intensity. There\nis an 8-mm cyst in the interpolar region of the left kidney.\nThere is a 1.6-cm hemorrhagic lesion in the upper pole of the\nright kidney.

Hypertensive Emergency: Hypertensive emergency occurred in\nthe setting of an apparent history of renal artery stenosis and\npatient being off all blood pressure medications x4 months.\nGiven elevated troponin, cardiac enzymes were cycled and\nremained flat.  EKG not concerning for ischemia, and patient did\nnot have any chest pain. TTE was suggestive of hypertensive\nheart disease. Patient continued on nitro gtt and esmolol gtt,\nand initially admitted to ICU overnight for close monitoring.\nPatient's BP improved on nitro and esmolol gtts, and he was\ntransitioned to oral antihypertensive regimen of nifedipine and\nImdur, then adjusted to find an outpatient regimen that would\nfacilitate compliance by being as cheap and infrequently dosed\nas possible.  After titration, this regimen was lisinopril 40mg\ndaily, carvedilol 50 [**Hospital1 **], and imdur 60mg, lasix 80 daily.  On\nthis regimen his blood pressures were in the 160s-170s/100s.\n**Titration of blood regimen will need to be addressed on\nfollow-up. The etiology of the patient's hypertension will also\nneed to be revisited as detailed below under Renal Artery\nStensosis.**\n.\n#. Question of Renal Artery Stenosis:  Patient with an apparent\nhistory of left renal artery stenosis diagnosed on ultrasound at\n[**Hospital1 2025**] 8/[**2193**]. Renal ultrasound here did not visualize left renal\nartery well, but does not reveal e/o right renal artery\nstenosis. Renal was consulted. They recommended MRI/MRA kidney\nto evaluate L renal artery which was negative for renal artery\nstenosis (though it was without contrast).  It was felt that\nrenal artery stenosis was unlikely and this was not further\npursued. **Renin, Angiotensin, and catecholamines were all\npending at the time of discharge.**\n.\n#. CHF: Patient presented with evidence of volume overload given\nelevated JVP, bilateral lower extremity edema.  CXR not\nsuggestive of florid pulmonary edema, though patient does have\nelevated BNP in addition to history of dyspnea, orthopnea, and\nPND.  [**Month (only) 116**] be acute on chronic process, in setting of\nhypertensive emergency, though also concern for CHF given more\nlong-standing symptoms.  CXR also suggests more chornic process\ngiven cardiomegaly, and EKG shows evidence of LVH and atrial\nenlargement.  Patient had TTE [**2-14**] which showed moderate\nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild global systolic\ndysfunction. Mild pulmonary hypertension. These findings are\nmost consistent with hypertensive heart disease. Was diuresed\nwith IV lasix and then transitioned to lasix 40mg PO BID with no\nelectrolyte repletion requirement for discharge. He was\ndischarged as detailed above in clinically euvolemic to mildly\nhypervolemic status breathing comfortably on RA with mild trace\nto 1+ LE edema. **Titration of diuretic and electrolyte\nrepletion will need to be revisited on follow-up.**\n.\n#. Renal Failure: Cr elevated to 2.9, baseline unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 116**] be\nchronic given history of untreated hypertension, but had concern\nfor malignant nephrosclerosis, which can occur in hypertensive\nemergencies and lead to acute renal failure, hematuria, and\nproteinuria.  UA demonstrated trace protein, but only 1 RBC.\nRenal ultrasound showed normal flow and resistive indices in the\nright main, upper and interpolar renal arteries. The left main\nand intrarenal arteries could not be adequately interrogated.\nRenal consulted, and recommended renal MRI and multiple urine\nstudies which showed bland urine sediment only notable for\nmicrohematuria.  Creatinine improved to 2.3 at the time of\ndischarge.\n.\n# Incidental Renal Cyst: Renal MRI showed an 8-mm cyst in the\ninterpolar region of the left kidney and a 1.6-cm hemorrhagic\nlesion in the upper pole of the right kidney.  This lesion could\nnot be definitvely evalutated without a contrast study.\n**Further studies may be helpful in further evaluating the cyst\nand hemorrhagic lesion in the future.**\n.\nINACTIVE ISSUES:\n.\n#. Anemia: Patient noted to be anemic, no baseline HCT for\ncomparison.  Iron studies demonstrated low iron at 21 (normal 45\n- 160 ug/dL). Normal TIBC, ferritin, transferrin. Iron started\nwith plan to continue as outpatient.\n.\n#. Asthma: No SOB or wheezing at present, and lung exam\nunremarkable.  Albuterol inhaler prn SOB/wheezing.\n.\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n-As above in **.\n-Because the patient's insurance application for MassHealth is\nnot yet approved, we were unable to schedule a PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 648**].\nWe gave him a phone number for [**Company 191**] to set up a PCP appointment,\nplus [**Name Initial (PRE) **] letter and his inpatient records in case he chose a PCP\noutside of the [**Hospital1 18**] system.

Resistive indices in the upper pole\n intrarenal artery are 0.63.  The main renal vein on the left is patent.\n Intrarenal Doppler of the mid and lower poles and the main renal artery could\n not be adequately obtained within the left kidney.\n\n The right kidney measures 10 cm, with normal waveform and resistive index of\n 0.66 in the main renal artery.  There is a 1.3 x 1.2 x 1.1 cm simple cyst.\n The main renal vein is patent.  Intrarenal resistive index in the upper pole\n of the right kidney is 0.64, and within the interpolar region is 0.59.  The\n lower pole intrarenal vessels could not be interrogated.  No perinephric fluid\n collections or hydronephrosis is noted in either kidney.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n Technically limited study showing normal flow and resistive indices in the\n right main, upper and interpolar renal arteries.  The left main and intrarenal\n arteries could not be adequately interrogated.  An MRI may be obtained for\n further evaluation if clinically necessary.\n                                                                       DFDdp\n\n"

The right atrium is moderately dilated.\nThere is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular\ncavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.\nOverall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta\nis mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.\nThe mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral\nregurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is\na trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild global\nsystolic dysfunction. Mild pulmonary hypertension. These findings are most\nconsistent with hypertensive heart disease.\n\n\n"
