Pt states he presented to [**Hospital3 **] today\n   and was found to be hypertensive and tachycardic.  He was treated with\n   ativan and labetalol.  He also reportedly had a CTA of his chest that\n   did not reveal a PE.  Subsequently, he was found to have a UTI and\n   given a dose of gentamycin.  Of note, patient was just discharged from\n   [**Hospital3 1672**] one week ago and completed a course of Levofloxacin this\n   morning.  Based on his labile blood pressures, the patient was\n   transferred to [**Hospital1 1**].\n   .\n   The patient suffered a C6 cord injury in [**2069**] following a motor vehicle\n   accident. His neurologic status has been stable for the past 33 years,\n   per his report.\n   .\n   Approximately 8 months ago he began experiencing episodes of\n   \"spasms\" associated with symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia. The spasms\n   are extensor only and begin in his legs and move proximally to involve\n   his hips, middle and upper back. Each extensor spasm lasts only a few\n   seconds, is recurrent every few minutes, and is painful, culminating in\n   discomfort in the left chest region. Associated with the spasms are:\n   acute onset severe headaches, blurred vision, mild sweating/hot\n   feeling, and a feeling of disorientation. Systolic blood pressure\n   (taken at work and at home) during these episodes is elevated to the\n   170-200 range. Sitting upright helps reduce the spasms and symptoms of\n   autonomic dysreflexia.\n   .\n   In the ED, initial vs were: 98.7 81 122/64 18 100, though he also had\n   an episode of hypotension in the 60s. Patient was given vancomycin for\n   concern for sepsis.  The patient received IVF and had a clonidine patch\n   was removed.  Admitted to MICU for hypotension with ? sepsis.\n   .\n   On the floor, patient continues to complain of spasms.  Denies any\n   dysuria, or fevers/chills.  Patient reports foley catheter was last\n   changed about a week ago.\n   .\n   Review of systems:\n   (+) Per HPI\n   (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.\n   Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies\n   cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest\n   pressure, palpitations, or weakness. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,\n   constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. Denies\n   dysuria, frequency, or urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias.

He does have a recent history of ESBL E. Coli in the\n   urine that was sensitive to Zosyn.\n   - Zosyn for possible ESBL e. coli.  Will narrow antibiotics based upon\n   culture data.\n   - change foley catheter if not changed in emergency department.\n   - f/u urine culture\n   - continue home detrol/imipramine\n   - consider urology consult for ? suprapubic catheter.\n   # Autonomic Dysreflexia/Spasticity - AD likely exacerbated by urinary\n   tract infections causing worsening of spasticity. Previous\n   exacerbations of autonomic dysreflexia have improved with treatment of\n   underlying UTI.\n   - Monitor blood pressure closely\n   - continue home dose baclofen/diazepam/clonazepam\n   - nitropaste for blood pressure > 200 systolic.\n- Consider Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation consultation\n   # Depression/Anxiety\n patient appears to be euthymic.\n   - continued on home dose imipramine, sertraline.\n   # Osteopenia - likely due to non-weight bearing status, muscular\n   atrophy, and possible autonomic nervous system changes.\n   - continue calcium/vitamin D\n   # GERD\n   - continue home omeprazole\n   .\n   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, heart healthy diet\n   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, bowel regimen\n   # Access: peripherals\n   # Communication: Patient\n   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient)\n   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition:\n   Glycemic Control:\n   Lines:\n   18 Gauge - [**2102-5-23**] 11:00 PM\n   20 Gauge - [**2102-5-23**] 11:00 PM\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT:\n   Stress ulcer:\n   VAP:\n   Comments:\n   Communication:  Comments:\n   Code status:\n   Disposition:\n   ------ Protected Section ------\n   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU\n   resident for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with\n   the note above, including the assessment and plan.  To that I would add\n   the following:\n   This is a 55 yo man with C6 paraplegia with known autonomic\n   dysreflexia, chronic UTIs, who is admitted to the ICU with\n   hypotension.  Of note, recently d/c\ns as above from an OSH with UTI.\n   Had a transient SBP in 60s in ED and lactate of 3.9.  In ICU, BPs have\n   normalized.  Will treat presumptively with Zosyn for UTI but have low\n   threshold to D/C given multiple recent abx courses.  Recheck lactate\n   suspect that it has normalized as well.\n   Patient is critically ill. Time spent 35 minutes.\n   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 2966**] [**Name8 (MD) 2967**], MD\n   on:[**2102-5-24**] 00:33 ------\n"

Patient was\ninitially admitted to unit for labile BP, including hypotension.\n Patient reports recently being treated for UTI at an OSH with\nlevofloxacin and macrobid.  He was discharged home with\nmacrobid.  He endorses increasing episodes of autonomic\ndysreflexia over the past few days despite being treated for\nESBL UTI.  He presented to OSH yesterday with these symptoms,\nand was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  The\npatient had endorsed chest pain that was not [**3-7**] ACS, and had\nCTA chest that was negative for PE.\n.\nApproximately 8 months ago he began experiencing episodes of\nautonomic dysreflexia. The muscle spasms associated with these\nepisodes are extensor only and begin in his legs and move\nproximally to involve his hips, middle and upper back. Each\nextensor spasm lasts only a few seconds, is recurrent every few\nminutes, and is painful, culminating in discomfort in the left\nchest region. Associated with the spasms are: acute onset severe\nheadaches, blurred vision, mild sweating/hot feeling, and a\nfeeling of disorientation. Systolic blood pressure (taken at\nwork and at home) during these episodes is elevated to the\n170-200 range. Sitting upright helps reduce the spasms and\nsymptoms of autonomic dysreflexia.\n.\nIn the ED, initial vs were: 98.7 81 122/64 18 100, though he\nalso had an episode of hypotension in the 60s. Patient was given\nvancomycin for concern for sepsis. Dropped pressures to the\n60's.  The patient received IVF and had a clonidine patch was\nremoved. Admitted to MICU for hypotension with ? sepsis.\n.\nIn the MICU, patient continued to complain of spasms. He denied\nany dysuria, fevers, or chills. Patient reports foley catheter\nwas last changed about a week ago. His UTI was positive for P.\nAeruginosa. His antibiotics were changed from zosyn to\nmeropenem.  His foley catheter was changed.\n.\nOn the medicine floor, the patient endorses spasms.  He denies\nchest pain/SOB.  He also denies f/c.  He has no abdominal pain.\nHe is concerned about his urologic care.  He had been followed\nby a urologist until recently.  He had a scheduled urodynamic\neval that he was not able to keep [**3-7**] his recent\nhospitalization.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\n(1) Traumatic C6 quadroplegia from car accident in [**2069**]\n(2) Neurogenic bladder, has had indwelling foley catheter for\nlast 10 years.\n(3) Dysreflexia - autonomic and somatic\n(4) Spasticity\n(5) Multiple UTIs (including ESBL E. coli)\n\nSocial History:\nLives alone, not married, no children.

Patient likely has\nchronic urinary tract infection or incompletely eradicated\nurinary tract infection.  He does have a recent history of ESBL\nE. Coli in the urine. He was initially started on Zosyn as prior\nESBL E. coli was listed as sensitive, but given this is also a\nbeta-lactam, he was converted to meropenem on the morning\nfollowing admission. Urine culture grew pan-sensitive\nPseudomonas.  Meropenem was continued, as patient had recent\nhistory of quinolone-resistent Enterococcus UTI and ESBL E. coli\nin past few months.  He was continued on home medications of\nDetrol and imipramine.  He was discharged on [**2102-5-26**] to rehab to\ncomplete a 10 day course of meropenem, a PICC was placed prior\nto discharge.  The patient will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] Urology at [**Hospital1 18**]\non [**2102-6-5**] to establish care and for evaluation of his recurrent\nUTIs and possible uro-dynamic studies, as he does not have\naccess to urologic care at home.\n\n# Autonomic Dysreflexia/Spasticity - Symptoms were likely\nexacerbated by urinary tract infections causing worsening of\nspasticity. Previous exacerbations of autonomic dysreflexia have\nimproved with treatment of underlying UTI. BPs were monitored\nclosely and improved to baseline levels on teh morning following\nadmission. The patient was continued on home doses of\nbaclofen/diazepam/clonazepam.  The patient required nitro paste\ntwice in the setting of elevated BP, with good effect.\n\n# Depression/Anxiety. The patient was continued on home doses of\nimipramine, and sertraline.\n\n# Osteopenia. Likely due to non-weight bearing status, muscular\natrophy, and possible autonomic nervous system changes. The\npatient was continued on his home calcium/vitamin D.\n\n# GERD.

Pt states he presented to [**Hospital3 **] today\n   and was found to be hypertensive and tachycardic.  He was treated with\n   ativan and labetalol.  He also reportedly had a CTA of his chest that\n   did not reveal a PE.  Subsequently, he was found to have a UTI and\n   given a dose of gentamycin.  Of note, patient was just discharged from\n   [**Hospital3 1672**] one week ago and completed a course of Levofloxacin this\n   morning.  Based on his labile blood pressures, the patient was\n   transferred to [**Hospital1 1**].\n   .\n   The patient suffered a C6 cord injury in [**2069**] following a motor vehicle\n   accident. His neurologic status has been stable for the past 33 years,\n   per his report.\n   .\n   Approximately 8 months ago he began experiencing episodes of\n   \"spasms\" associated with symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia. The spasms\n   are extensor only and begin in his legs and move proximally to involve\n   his hips, middle and upper back. Each extensor spasm lasts only a few\n   seconds, is recurrent every few minutes, and is painful, culminating in\n   discomfort in the left chest region. Associated with the spasms are:\n   acute onset severe headaches, blurred vision, mild sweating/hot\n   feeling, and a feeling of disorientation. Systolic blood pressure\n   (taken at work and at home) during these episodes is elevated to the\n   170-200 range. Sitting upright helps reduce the spasms and symptoms of\n   autonomic dysreflexia.\n   .\n   In the ED, initial vs were: 98.7 81 122/64 18 100, though he also had\n   an episode of hypotension in the 60s. Patient was given vancomycin for\n   concern for sepsis.  The patient received IVF and had a clonidine patch\n   was removed.  Admitted to MICU for hypotension with ? sepsis.\n   .\n   On the floor, patient continues to complain of spasms.  Denies any\n   dysuria, or fevers/chills.  Patient reports foley catheter was last\n   changed about a week ago.\n   .\n   Review of systems:\n   (+) Per HPI\n   (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.\n   Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies\n   cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest\n   pressure, palpitations, or weakness. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,\n   constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. Denies\n   dysuria, frequency, or urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias.
