Follow-up\noutpatient ultrasound approximately one month after the injury\nultrasound which detected three splenic artery aneurysms. Thus\nhe\nwas taken to the interventional suite with angiography today.\nThe\nprocedure was uneventful but they were unable to embolize either\nof the three aneurysms due to aberrant anatomy. During the\nprocedure, pt HR dropped to 30s with advancement of guidewire\nand with breath holding. There was concern for rupture of\npseudoaneurysm (per ACS). Pt went to PACU and became bradycardic\nto 30s when sheath was removed. SBP dropped to 70s. 1 amp\nAtropine was given and 1.5L of fluid was given. He has been HD\nstable.\n\nPatient was former athlete and used to run track. He walks at a\nfast pace on his treadmil 30 min every day.

Serial hematocrits\nwere checked and remained stable. Cardiology consult obtained.\nTheir suspicion was that he was hypovolemic in the setting of\nbeta blockade, contributing to bradycardia and intermittent\nhypotension. He tolerated a regular diet and was transferred to\nthe floor.\n\nOnce stabalized it was decided that he have a splenectomy given\nthe high risk of a rebleed.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1413**] was present throughout the procedure.\n\n SEDATION:  Moderate sedation with divided doses of intravenous 175 mcg\n fentanyl and 3.5 mg Versed over 180 minutes, during which patient's\n hemodynamic status was continuously monitored by a trained radiology nurse.\n\n CONTRAST:  170 mL Visipaque 320.\n\n OTHER MEDICATION:  IV cefazolin and IV fluids 350 mL.\n\n ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  About 20 mL.\n\n PROCEDURES:\n 1.

A\n 0.018 wire was advanced into the lower abdominal aorta.  Needle was exchanged\n over the wire for a 4.5 microsheath.  Inner cannula and wire were removed to\n place a 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 471**] wire, which was advanced into the abdominal aorta.\n Microsheath was removed to place a 5 French [**Last Name (un) 578**]-Tip sheath.  Inner cannula\n was removed.  Sidearm was aspirated and flushed, and connected to a continuous\n heparinized saline flush. A C2 glide cath was used to access the celiac\n trunk/SMA and perform an angiogram.  Based on the variant anatomy (described\n in the findings), the C2 catheter was attempted to be advanced into the\n splenic artery, however, it was unstable.  Subsequently, various catheters,\n including C2 glide cath, C2, [**Last Name (un) 1321**] and SOS catheters were used to attempt\n access the splenic artery but were unstable while advancing Glidewire more\n distally into the splenic artery.  Following these attempts, the C2 Cobra was\n placed at the common origin of SMA and splenic artery and a Renegade Hi-[**Last Name (un) 1242**] -\n Transcend microwire set was placed via the C2 catheter and advanced into the\n splenic artery.  Angiogram was performed.  Multiple attempts were made to\n advance the microcatheter - microwire set as distally as possible to attempt\n selective embolization of pseudoaneurysms, however, the catheter system was\n unstable and flopped back into the aorta.  Microcatheter and main catheter\n were removed.  Right groin sheath was then removed and firm pressure was\n applied for about 20 minutes to achieve complete hemostasis.  Patient\n tolerated the procedure well.\n\n FINDINGS:\n 1.  Mesenteric angiogram demonstrated variant anatomy with origins of celiac\n trunk and SMA abutting each other.  Left hepatic and left gastric arteries\n likely have a common origin just cranial to the SMA origin.\n 2. The Spelnic artery and right hepatic artery arisw from the SMA.\n 3.  Three pseudoaneurysms measuring about 3.1 x 3.6 cm in the interpolar\n region, 2.5 x 1.8 cm in the interpolar to lower pole and 7 mm in the upper\n pole peripherally. Also, an early draining vein filling the splenic vein\n arises from the lower of the wo hilar pseudoaneurysm suggesting an A-V\n communication.\n 4. Inability to gain adequate distal enough access to the vessels supplying\n the pseudoaneurysms to consider safely embolizing them.\n\n INTRA-PROCEDURE AND POST-PROCEDURE COURSE:  One episode of tachycardia during\n the procedure.  Subsequently, in the recovery room, the patient had a bout of\n bradycardia and hypotension.  With about 2 liters of fluid (normal saline and\n 5% dextrose) and 1 mg atropine, patient's heart rate and blood pressure\n stabilized.\n\n IMPRESSION:  Splenic angiogram demonstrated three pseudoaneurysms and a\n possible AV fistula, however, selective catheterization and embolization was\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2151-11-9**] 10:35 AM\n HEPATIC                                                         Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 33768**]\n Reason: angiogram of spleen, +/- intervention with embolization for\n  Contrast: VISAPAQUE Amt: 170\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n not technically feasible.
