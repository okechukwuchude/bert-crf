[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]\nApproved: TUE [**2124-10-31**] 2:44 AM\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>EGD from admission:<b/>\nFindings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.\nStomach:  Mucosa: Atrophy of the mucosa was noted in the antrum.\n\nDuodenum:  Protruding Lesions There was a question of a small\nsub-mucosal mass of benign appearance at the duodenal bulb.\nExcavated Lesions A few ulcers were found in the duodenal bulb\nas well as duodenitis. These were considered low risk for\nbleeding.  Other procedures: As ulcers and duodenitis were\nconsidered low risk, decision was made to proceed with PEG\nplacement. A 20FR percutaneous gastrostomy tube (PEG) was placed\nsuccessfully using standard techniques at the stomach body.\n <br>\nImpression: Atrophy in the antrum\nLow risk ulcers and duodenitis in the duodenal bulb\nSuccessful PEG placement (PEG)\nQuestion of small submucosal mass in duodenal bulb.\nOtherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum\nRecommendations: High dose protonix 40 mg twice a day\nPlease check H. Pylori serology and treat if positive\nNo further intervention for now for question of submucosal mass\nunless symptomatic or further bleeding.\n[**Month (only) 116**] use tube for essential meds if needed tonight. Can start\ntube feeding tomorrow.\nDuodenitis and ulcer may have accounted for slow hct decline.\n<br>\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname **] is a 85 year old man with a history of Alzheimer's,\ndiverticulosis, recently diagnosed colon CA, status post\nhemicolectomy on [**2124-10-9**] presented with dark stools and acute\nblood loss anemia and malnutrition from The [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].\n\nIn the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] NG lavage was negative by report.  He was\ninitially admitted to the Medical ICU, and given 2 Units of\nPRBCs.  He was hemodynamically stable and underwent EGD,\nrevealing:  \"Atrophy in the antrum, Low risk ulcers and\nduodenitis in the duodenal bulb, Successful PEG placement (PEG),\nQuestion of small submucosal mass in duodenal bulb, Otherwise\nnormal EGD to third part of the duodenum.\"  It was felt these\nulcers were likely accounting for the blood loss and occult\nblood positive stools.  H. pylori Ab was positive and he was\nstarted on antimicrobial therapy as well as twice daily PPI\ntreatment.\n<br>\nMr. [**Known lastname **] was called out of the unit to the general medical\nfloor.  Once on the General Medical Floor, he had trouble\ntolerating his TFs initially with emesis and nausea.  CT scan\nrevealed the G tube curled up proximally into the esophagus.\nThe GI Fellow pulled the tube back and abdominal x-ray showed it\nno longer in the esophagus.  TFs were resumed and the patient\nhad no difficuties thereafter.\n<br>\nAlzheimer's Dementia and Depression:  Pt oriented to self, but\nnot place or time. He was continued on Namenda and Aricept per\nhome regimen. He was continued on his mirtazapine and his TSH\nwas normal.\n<br>\nSubmucosal Mass seen on EGD:  Unclear if this requires\nfollow-up.  See EGD report attached.\n<br>\nRemaining open surgical wound:  minimal opening, excellent\ngranulation tissue, no evidence for infection, appears to be\nhealing well.  Continue conservative care as directed.\n<br>\nMucinous Adenocarcinoma with 1/3 positive lymph nodes,\nadenopathy seen on CT scan:  Consider outpatient follow up with\nGI oncology if patient/family desire.  I personally discussed\nthe above findings and recommendations with the patient's HCP\nand son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 99269**] and his questions were\nanswered to his apparent satisfaction.\n<br>\nDuring the patient's admission, he was a FULL CODE.  You may\nconsider readdressing this in the future.\n<br>\nPlease note, the patient may have some dark stools given his\nrecent GI bleed, but this should resolve over time.  You may\nconsider checking a Hct if you are concerned that he is bleeding\nagain, though the suspicion that his duodenal ulcers will bleed\nany more is small as he is on treatment for H. pylori and a high\ndose PPI.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nRemeron 15mg qHS\nOmeprazole 20 mg PO bid\nCelexa 20mg daily\nAricept 10mg daily\nNamenda 10mg daily\nSenna\nFerrous sulfate\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Right lateral decubitus and supine abdominal radiographs.\n\n The exact tip of the gastrostomy tube is not definitely seen but appears to\n have been retracted and now projects over the lower midline abdomen.  There is\n no evidence of pneumatosis or pneumoperitoneum.  Oral contrast is noted to\n fill the large bowel which displays a known severe diverticulosis.  Layering\n left pleural effusion is noted, better appreciated on the decubitus view.\n Surgical chain sutures within the mid right lower abdomen are unchanged.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n 1.  Limited abdominal radiographs to definitely identify the tip of the\n gastrostomy tube without any oral contrast within the tube itself.  It does\n appear to have been retracted and now projects over the lower midline.\n\n 2.  Known freely layering moderate-sized left pleural effusion.\n\n 3.  No evidence of pneumoperitoneum.  Extensive colonic diverticulosis.\n\n"
