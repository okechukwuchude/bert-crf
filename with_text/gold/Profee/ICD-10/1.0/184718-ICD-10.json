Right common\n femoral artery arteriogram and Angio-Seal closure of right common femoral\n artery puncture site.\n\n DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:\n\n The patient was brought to the angiography suite.  IV sedation was given.\n Following this, both groins were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.\n Access was gained to the right common femoral artery using a Seldinger\n technique and a 6 French vascular sheath was placed in the right common\n femoral artery.  We now catheterized the right internal carotid artery with a\n [**Doctor Last Name 586**] 2 catheter and the [**Doctor Last Name 586**] 2 catheter was exchanged over an exchange\n length glidewire for a Neuron 6 French catheter.  Following this, the patient\n was fully anticoagulated to maintain an ACT close to 250.  We now passed a\n Marksman catheter over a Synchro wire into the right middle cerebral artery.\n Through this, a Neuroform EZ 4.5 x 20 mm stent was deployed across the neck of\n the paraclinoid aneurysm.  The Marksman catheter was removed and the aneurysm\n was recatheterized through the cells of the Neuroform stent using an SL-10\n microcatheter and a Synchro wire.  The aneurysm was coiled starting with a\n 3-mm 360 UltraSoft Target coil, followed by 2 mm coil.  Followed this, the\n aneurysm was completely obliterated.  The ophthalmic artery was seen to be\n patent.  Right common femoral artery arteriogram was done and a 6 French\n Angio-Seal was used for closure of the right common femoral artery puncture\n site.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was neurologically intact\n at the end of the procedure.\n\n FINDINGS:\n\n Right internal carotid artery arteriogram demonstrates a 4-mm aneurysm\n projecting laterally from the paraclinoid segment at the level of the\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2179-7-26**] 3:04 PM\n CAROT/CEREB [**Hospital1 **]                                                  Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 41713**]\n Reason: Stent assisted coiling via cerebral angiogram Anesthesia has\n  Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 128\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n ophthalmic artery.\n\n Right internal carotid artery arteriogram status post stenting and coiling\n demonstrates that the internal carotid artery is patent in the cavernous and\n supraclinoid portion.  There is no stenosis secondary to stent placement, the\n aneurysm is completely obliterated by a coil mass.  The ophthalmic artery is\n patent.\n\n Right common femoral artery arteriogram shows widely patent right common\n femoral artery.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n [**Known firstname **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1247**] [**Known lastname 1560**] underwent cerebral angiography, which revealed a right\n paraclinoid aneurysm measuring 4 mm which was coiled with the assistance of a\n Neuroform stent.  The procedure was uneventful.\n\n"
