Renal transplant\nultrasound was normal except for large subcutaneous fluid\ncollection that was also noted on CT.  On hospital day 1, there\nwas concern for rejection.  She was started on solumedrol 500mg\nIV qday for this concern pending biopsy results.  Renal biopsy\nshowed no signs of rejection, but was consistent with rapidly\nprogressing FSGS. IV solumedrol was decreased from 500 to 100 mg\nqday on day 3 then ultimately switched to Prednisone 60 mg qday\non day 5--which was continued throughout admission and continued\non discharge.  Studies into the etioogy of the FSGS were\nnegative -- HIV negative, BK virius negative, ANCA negative,\ncompliment levels normal, Hepatitis serology negative, [**Doctor First Name **] 1:40,\nparvo b19 and HTLV negative. Urine output was monitored as best\nas possible, however patient was non-compliant with collection.\n UA with no signs of urinary tract infection.  On hospital day\n3, plasmapheresis was empirically initiated.  During her\nplasmapheresis courses, calcium levels were noted to be low and\nwere repleted on an as needed basis.  She received 4 sessions of\nplasmapheresis, however due to development of fever and signs of\ninfection on hospital day 10 this was not continued.  Urine\nProtein/Creatinine ratio was monitored on a daily basis during\nthe initial part of admission peaking at 30.7 then trending down\nto 1.7 after 2 weeks.  Throughout admission, hemodialysis was\ndone on as needed basis with one 9-day period of no\nhemodialysis.  Patient will continue dialysis as outpatient, as\nwell as prednisone and tacrolimus.  She should follow up with\nTransplant nephrology as arranged.  Should continue tacrolimus\nwith goal trough [**5-5**].  Dose was decreased to 4mg [**Hospital1 **] on day of\ndischarge for elevated trough 9.1.  Please contact transplant\nnephrology at [**Hospital1 18**] for dose adjustments.  Please check tacro\nlevels on Thursday, [**2149-8-28**], and regularly there after.\nShe should continue prednisone at 60mg daily for now.  She\nshould remain on GI prophylaxis, Ca/Vit D as ordered.  Patient\nshould be considered for starting dapsone for PCP prophylaxis in\nthe future rather than atovaquone, but given h/o severe bactrim\nallergy did not challenge with dapsone on this hospitalization.\nG6PD testing was negative.\n-Please send all lab work to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**]-\n.\n# Hemodialysis: Patient to receive T/Th/Sa dialysis as\noutpatient.  At dialysis, she should receive epogen.  In\naddition, she should have PTH, Vitamin D and Iron studies drawn\nat dialysis. She should continue cinacalcet as outpatient and\nvitamin D as follows (50,000 units weekly x 8 weeks, followed by\n1000 units daily thereafter until replete.).  Patient has a slot\nat [**Hospital4 117**] [**Hospital5 **] [**Hospital6 **] after she leaves rehab.\n.\n# C. difficile infection - On day 10 of admission, patient was\nnoted to be febrile.  Patient was also complaining of LLQ\nabdominal pain, but no other associated symptoms.  At this time\npatient was started empirically on cefepime and flagyl for\nsuspected diverticulitis given findings of sigmoid colon wall\nthickening on CT Abdomen and pelvis.  Blood and urine cultures\nwere drawn and negative.  UA negative for UTI.  CXR had no\ninterval change of right basalar atelectasis and patient was\nasymptommatic.  Patient continued to have fevers and vancomycin\nadded on hospital day 12.  Additionally valgancyclovir and\natovoqoune were added at this time for prophylaxis while on high\ndose steroids.  Patient continued to be febrile and complained\nof diarrhea, ID consult felt symptoms were most consistent for\nC. Difficile (had recieved one dose of ceftazadime on\nadmission).  Adenovirus PCT, Toxo serology and stool O&P were\nnegative.  Stool was positive for C. Diff and po vancomycin\nstarted.  Cefepime, flagyl and vancomycin were discontinued.\nPatient had 2 more fevers over the first 48 hours of PO\nvancomycin treatment then was afebrile.  Of note, diarrhea\nwork-up was positive for CMV viral load in blood possibly\nconsistent with CMV colitis (see below). Patient should complete\na 14 day course of PO vancomycin to end on [**2149-9-2**].\n.\n# CMV viremia - patient had detectable CMV viral load during\ndiarrheal work-up.  At the time of detection, patient had been\non valgancyclovir prophylaxis for 4 days.  Initially, it was\nfelt to be viremia w/o end organ involvement, however due to\ncontinued diarrhea on PO vancomycin for C. difficile infection,\ntreatment was changed from valgancyclovir to gancyclovir for\ntreatment of possible CMV disease.  She should be continued on\nIV ganciclovir for treatment of CMV viremia until she has 2\nnegative CMV viral loads separated by one week.  (viral load\n[**8-20**] 861, repeat viral load [**8-25**] pending).\n.\n# Hyperkalemia: Mrs. [**Known lastname 6357**] was diagnosed with elevated\npotassium on admission to the ED.  She had mild peaked T waves\nin V2. In the ED, she received 2 rounds of calcium, insulin and\nwas transferred to the ICU where medical management for\nhyperkalemia was more effective, but she still required emergent\ndialysis.  After a short course of emergent dialysis there was\nimprovement in her electrolytes. Potassium was monitored closely\nthroughout her admission while she underwent intermittant\nhemodialysis.\n.\n\n# Atrial fibrillation: Mrs. [**Known lastname 6357**] went into atrial\nfibrillation with RVR on the  evening of [**8-4**] after dialysis.\nShe had no prior history. Had some chest pain during episode and\nwas ruled out. The atrial fibrillation was converted with\nmetoprolol then Diltiazem IV and she had no further episodes on\ntelemetry.  She was continued on metoprolol for rate control and\nhypertension.  Hydralazine was discontinued.  Echo showed a\nmildly dilated left atrium and LVEH > 55%.  TSH was WNL.  After\none week, telemetry was discontinued.\n.\n# Hypertension: Mrs. [**Known lastname 6357**] was not previously on\nanti-hypertensives prior to admission.  On admission, she was\nnoted to be hypertensive and started on hydralazine and\namlodipine.  After her episode of atrial fibrillation, she was\nalso on hydralazine.  Hydralazine ws discontinued after 2 days\nwith good blood pressure control on metoprolol and amlodipine.\nBlood pressure was monitored and stable throughout her hospital\ncourse with some episodes of hypotension during dialysis.\nAmlodipine was changed to be dosed after dialysis and metoprolol\nreduced to 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].  At discharge, amlodipine was\ndiscontinued due to its tendency to cause lower extremity edema,\nand b/c hypotension had limited her HD sessions.  Metoprolol\nshould be continued and titrated up as needed for hypertension.\n.\n# SLE: stable; on prednisone for FSGS.\n.\n# Anemia - continued iron supplement, epogen with HD as above,\ntransfusions as needed.\n.\n# Access: PICC line in place.

Normal interatrial septum.\nNo ASD by 2D or color Doppler.\n\nLEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and regional/global\nsystolic function (LVEF>55%). No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.\n\nRIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.\n\nAORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated ascending\naorta. Mildly dilated aortic arch.\n\nAORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No valvular AS. The increased\ntransaortic velocity is related to high cardiac output. No AR.\n\nMITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. No MS. Mild to\nmoderate ([**11-29**]+) MR.\n\nTRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. No TS. Mild to\nmoderate [[**11-29**]+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.\n\nPULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS.\n\nPERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.\n\nConclusions:\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or\ncolor Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with\nnormal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is\nno ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall\nmotion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is\nmildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with\ngood leaflet excursion. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased\ntransaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output. No aortic\nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There\nis no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**11-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is\nseen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2147-9-12**], the degree of\nMR has slightly increased.\n\n\n"

Has been maintained on tacrolimus\n   with unclear diligence with followup recently. Now presenting to [**Hospital1 1**]\n   ED with dysuria, abdominal, flank and bilateral lower back pain. In\n   [**Hospital1 1**] ED found to be in acute renal failure (Creatinine 14.7) with\n   significant hyperkalemia (6.7) that was initially treated with\n   kayexalate, insulin, D50 and calcium. No EKG changes or chest pain.\n   Transferred to MICU Green.\n   Currently in MICU, patient reports no chest pain or dyspnea. Moderate\n   bilateral lower back pain. HR 84, Sat 92-95 on 2L NC, RR 20, BP 170/74,\n   JVP difficult to assess, MM dry, lungs cta, RRR w/o rub, abd nontender\n   including over incision. No focal CVAT. Neuro no asterixis.

She\n   is presenting with acute renal failure, acidosis and hyperkalemia and\n   our concern is for rejection vs infection (minimal symptoms of this).\n   We will check tacrolimus level, pulse with 500 mg daily prednisone on\n   top of baseline tacrolimus (per transplant renal) and consider graft\n   biopsy in near future. Will also need urgent treatment for hyperkalemia\n   with repeat kayexalate, D50, insulin, calcium and bicarbonate. We will\n   likely need to institute hemodialysis tonight given rising hyperkalemia\n   despite adequate therapy.
