She is symptomatic with dyspnea on\nexertion and 3 pillow orthopnea however her symptoms vary in the\nsense that she often has days where she is very active without\nlimitation or symptoms.

No spontaneous\necho contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium\nor left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen\nin the body of the right atrium. Left ventricular wall\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is\nnormal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal\n(LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated\nwith normal free wall contractility. There are simple atheroma\nin the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the\ndescending thoracic aorta. There is severe aortic valve stenosis\n(valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is\nmoderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nPOST CPB:\n1.Preserved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function\n2. A bioprosthetic valve is identified in aortic position. Well\nseated and good leaflet excursion. Np AI. Peak transvslvular\ngradient of 45 mm Hg, with carfiac output = 6.5 liters/min.\n3. MR is now mild.\n4.

Valvular heart disease.\nStatus: Inpatient\nDate/Time: [**2137-5-7**] at 11:01\nTest: TEE (Complete)\nDoppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler\nContrast: None\nTechnical Quality: Adequate\n\n\nINTERPRETATION:\n\nFindings:\n\nLEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in\nthe body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) 4**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5**] LAA. All four pulmonary veins not identified.\n\nRIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No spontaneous echo contrast\nin the body of the RA. A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA and\nextending into the RV.\n\nLEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D\nimages. Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size. Low normal LVEF.\n\nLV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal; basal\nanteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal inferoseptal - normal;\nmid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior - normal;\nbasal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal anterolateral\n- normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal; septal apex -\nnormal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex - normal;\n\nRIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity.

No TEE related complications.\n\nConclusions:\nPRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or\nthrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No\nspontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium. Left\nventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is\nnormal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF\n50-55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall\ncontractility. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are\ncomplex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There is severe\naortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation\nis seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate\nthickening of the mitral valve chordae. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nPOST CPB:\n1.Preserved [**Hospital1 36**]-ventricular systolic function\n2. A bioprosthetic valve is identified in aortic position. Well seated and\ngood leaflet excursion. Np AI. Peak transvslvular gradient of 45 mm Hg, with\ncarfiac output = 6.5 liters/min.\n3. MR is now mild.\n4. No other change\n\n\n"
