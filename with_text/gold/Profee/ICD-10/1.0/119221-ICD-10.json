Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient was initially\nhypotensive in the 60s which quickly rose to the 120s after 4\nliters of normal saline and 4 units of pRBCs. An IV PPI was\nstarted which was later switched to oral on the floor. The\npatient had a negative NG lavage and endoscopy revealed no\nsuspected bleeding at the previous bleeding site. Since there\nwas no evidence of upper GI bleeding, a colonoscopy was\nperformed next. The colonoscopy revealed diverticulosis, but no\nareas of active bleeding. The gastroenterologist recommended a\ncapsule study to evaluate the GI tract. The patient underwent\nthe capsule study and the results will be available after\ndischarge. After the initial fluid resusitation and\ntransfusions, the patient remained hemodynamically stable. He\nhad no episodes of GI bleeding and stable hematocrits. The\npatient was advised to continuing taking his PPI. His aspirin\nwas stopped on his previous admission and restarting it should\nbe addressed as an outpatient. His discharge hematocrit was\n33.3.\n.\n# Cellulitis on left hip: The patient was started on Vancomycin\nand the erythema decreased significantly. The patient was then\nswitched to Augmentin for a total 7 day course of treatment that\nends on [**9-27**].\n.\n# Leukocytosis: The patinet had a moderate leukocytosis while in\nthe hospital. It might have been due to his GIB or the\ncellulitis. On previous admission, the primary team found out\nthat the patient had a high WBC at baseline and recommended\noutpatient followup. On discharge, the WBC count was 11.9.\n.\n#Acute Renal Insufficiency: The patient presented with acute\nrenal failure, likely pre-renal in the setting of acute GI\nbleed. With fluid resusitation, the creatinine returned to\nbaseline.\n\nOutpatient followup:\n1. hematocrit, WBC\n2. restarting aspirin\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1. Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H as needed for pain.\n2. Lisinopril 10 mg PO DAILY.\n3. Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q12H.\n4. Zolpidem 5 mg PO HS as needed for insomnia.\n5. Docusate Sodium 100mg PO BID.\n6.
