Improved mass effect on the fourth ventricle and persistent\n  leftward shift of the cerebellar vermis. At the time of this preliminary\n  report, MRI of the head is planned.\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n INDICATION:  63-year-old female with right cerebellar hemorrhagic lesion\n status post resection. History of metastatic melanoma.\n\n COMPARISON:  Preoperative studies, most recently dated [**2105-8-30**].  No\n postoperative studies available for comparison.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT images through the head were acquired without intravenous\n contrast.\n\n FINDINGS:  There has been interval suboccipital craniectomy and right\n cerebellar lesion resection. There is pneumocephalus concentrated in the right\n cerebellar surgical bed, but also in the left posterior fossa and left\n supratentorial compartment. There is fluid with peripheral hyperdensity in the\n surgical bed.  There is partial improvement in mass effect on the fourth\n ventricle, which is minimally shifted to the left but patent, and improved but\n persistent leftward shift of the cerebellar vermis.  There is no\n supratentorial hydrocephalus.  There is preservation of supratentorial\n [**Doctor Last Name 37**]-white matter differentiation.\n\n A sclerotic lesion arising from the right occipital condyle protrudes into the\n foramen magnum on the right, as seen previously, compatible with an ossified\n meningioma or an osteoma.\n\n Visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear well\n aerated.\n\n IMPRESSION:  Suboccipital craniectomy and postoperative changes in the right\n cerebellum.  Partially improved mass effect on the fourth ventricle and\n partially improved leftward shift of the cerebellar vermis.\n                                                                       DFDkq\n\n"

Pneumocephalus is noted.  The previously seen mass effect\n and narrowing of the fourth ventricle has partially improved.  The lateral and\n third ventricles are unchanged in size, without hydrocephalus.  In the\n resection bed, there is marginal T1 hyperintensity, as well as foci of low\n signal on gradient echo images, indicating blood products.  There is also thin\n linear enhancement along the margins of the surgical cavity, and dural\n enhancement along the lateral aspect of the surgical cavity, most consistent\n with postoperative changes.  There is no evidence of nodular contrast\n enhancement. There is no acute infarction. The major intracranial vessel flow\n voids are preserved.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n Blood products in the right cerebellar surgical bed and thin linear\n enhancement along the surgical cavity margins, without clear evidence for a\n residual mass. Recommend follow up after blood products resolve.\n\n"
