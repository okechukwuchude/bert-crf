No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the\nLA/LAA or the RA/RAA.\n\nRIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. PFO is present.\n\nLEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. Overall normal\nLVEF (>55%).\n\nRIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.\n\nAORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal calcifications in\naortic root. Moderately dilated ascending aorta. Focal calcifications in\nascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Normal descending aorta\ndiameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta. Focal calcifications in\ndescending aorta.\n\nAORTIC VALVE: Bicuspid aortic valve. Severe AS (area 0.8-1.0cm2).

The patient was under\ngeneral anesthesia throughout the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with\nassistance from the anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related\ncomplications. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results were\npersonally reviewed with the MD caring for the patient.

No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen\nin the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right\natrium/right atrial appendage.\nA patent foramen ovale is present with left to right flow under anesthesia\nThere is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular\ncavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal\n(LVEF>55%).\nRight ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.\nThe ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are simple atheroma in the\ndescending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve is bicuspid. There is severe\naortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation\nis seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation\nis seen. There is no pericardial effusion.\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) 32**] was notified in person of the results on [**Known firstname 1262**] [**Known lastname 1263**] before\nsurgical incision.\n\nPOST-BYPASS:\nPreserved biventricualr systolic function.\nIntact thoracic aorta and the tube graft in the ascening aorta is visualized\nwell with a good contour and no leaks\nAortic bioprosthetic valve is well seated and functioning well with a residual\npeak gradient of 28mm of Hg peak and 15mm of Hg mean.\nMild MR [**First Name (Titles) 60**] [**Last Name (Titles) **].\n\n\n"
