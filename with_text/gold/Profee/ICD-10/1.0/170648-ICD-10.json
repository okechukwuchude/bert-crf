EGD findings suggest stents unlikely to course\n via native upper cbd.  Request to perform angiogram to identify source of\n bleeding and to perform a cholangiogram to evaluate the biliary stents plus\n minus intervention.\n\n RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 611**] [**Name (STitle) 8814**], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 331**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5473**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**]\n performed the procedure.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 5473**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4101**], the attending radiologists,\n were present throughout the procedure.\n\n ANESTHESIA:  The procedure was performed under general anesthesia with local\n 1% lidocaine used as well.\n\n PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After explaining the risks, benefits and alternatives\n of the procedure, written informed consent was obtained.  The patient was\n brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table.  The\n right upper abdomen and the right groin were prepped and draped in standard\n sterile fashion.

[**Name (NI) 83622**] PTC.\n 6.  Extension of right hepatic ductal stent.\n 7.  Placement of 8 French internal-external biliary drainage catheter.\n\n Using fluoroscopic and palpatory guidance, the right common femoral artery was\n accessed using a 19-gauge arterial needle, through which [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 89**] wire was\n advanced into the abdominal aorta under fluoroscopic guidance.  Needle was\n exchanged for a 5 French [**Last Name (un) 67**]-Tip sheath which was connected to a continuous\n saline sidearm flush.  A 5 French C2 catheter was then advanced over the\n [**Last Name (un) 89**] wire and used to select the superior mesenteric artery and a selective\n SMA run performed.  No active extravasation or pseudoaneurysm was seen.  There\n was irregularity of the branches coming off the inferior pancreaticoduodenal\n artery.  Celiac arteriography with selectives then performed via the C2\n catheter as described below.  Using Merit microcatheter and Transcend\n microwire the SMA was recatheterized, and IPDA was superselectively\n catheterized and a selective arteriogram performed.  This, however, did not\n demonstrate any active extravasation or pseudoaneurysm formation.  In\n addition, even a 0.016 Transcend wire was unable to traverse the stenotic path\n into this artery. Collaterals arising off the IPDA was also seen contributing\n significantly to the middle colic artery.  As a result embolization was not\n performed at this location.\n\n The C2 catheter was then used to select the celiac artery ostium and a\n selective celiac arteriogram performed.  The catheter was then advanced into\n the common hepatic and subsequently selective common hepatic, GDA and right\n hepatic arteriograms were performed.  By performing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 55838**] loop on the C2\n catheter, the left gastric artery ostium was catheterized and a selective left\n gastric arteriogram performed.  No active arterial extravasation was seen.\n After discussing the findings with the surgical team, it was decided to\n perform prophylactic embolization of the gastroduodenal artery.\n\n The C2 catheter was again advanced into the celiac artery and used to select\n the common hepatic artery.  A 0.035 Glidewire was then navigated into the GDA.\n The C2 catheter was advanced over the Glidewire into the proximal\n gastroduodenal artery.  Using a combination of a Transcend microwire and a\n Merit Maestro microcatheter, GDA was selectively catheterized and the\n microcatheter was advanced into the distal GDA.  Coil embolization of the GDA\n was then performed subsequently by deploying multiple 2-mm, 3-mm and 4-mm\n sized Hilal coils right up to origin of the gastroduodenal artery from the\n common hepatic artery.  Post-embolization common hepatic arteriogram was\n performed confirming no flow through the GDA.  The catheter and sheath were\n removed and hemostasis was achieved by manual compression for 20 minutes.\n Sterile dressings were applied.\n\n FINDINGS ON THE ARTERIOGRAM:\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2106-4-15**] 9:11 AM\n HEPATIC                                                         Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 83621**]\n Reason: Please perform angio for ? embolization if source of bleedin\n Admitting Diagnosis: UPPER GI BLEED\n  Contrast: VISAPAQUE Amt: 270\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n 1.  Calcified atherosclerosis of abdominal aorta.\n 2.  Celiac common hepatic, left gastric, GDA and right hepatic arteriograms\n revealed no active arterial extravasation or pseudoaneurysm formation. The\n patient is s/p splenectomy.\n 3.  Venous phase of SMA run shows prominent mesenteric veins and what appears\n to be recanalization of cavernous transformation of the portal vein with\n hepatopetal flow. Moderate sized esophageal varices also seen.\n 4.  Small right hepatic arterio-portal fistula.\n 5.  SMA arteriogram reveals small irregular arterial branch coming off the\n IPDA.  Superselective IPDA angiogram performed, which did not show any active\n arterial extravasation.  Collateral branches contributing to the middle colic\n artery seen supplying the watershed region of the splenic flexure, and in view\n of these the IPDA was not embolized.\n 6.  Successful microcoil embolization of the gastroduodenal artery with good\n angiographic results.\n\n Attention was now directed towards performing the PTC.  Under fluoroscopic\n guidance, a 21-gauge Cook needle was used to access the right posterior ductal\n system and a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram performed.  A peripheral\n right posterior duct was then selected and accessed using a second Cook\n needle.  A 0.018 Headliner wire was advanced through the needle into the right\n hepatic duct.  The Cook needle was exchanged for an AccuStick sheath set.  The\n metal stiffener and inner dilator were removed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 89**] wire was advanced\n through the sheath into the duodenum.  The AccuStick sheath was then exchanged\n for 6 French [**Last Name (un) 67**]-Tip sheath.  An angled glide catheter was then used to\n exchange the [**Last Name (un) 89**] wire for an Amplatz wire.  A pullback cholangiogram was\n then performed.  Based on the findings of the cholangiogram it was decided to\n extend the right-sided ductal stent.  A marker catheter was advanced over the\n Amplatz wire and after making appropriate measurements, an 8 mm x 60 mm\n Wallstent was advanced over the Amplatz wire.  Proximal end of the stent was\n positioned within the covered stent in the right duct and the distal end of\n the stent was positioned within the third part of duodenum.  The stent was\n then sequentially balloon dilated using 6 mm x 4 cm [**Last Name (un) 19795**] balloon.\n Post-balloon dilatation cholangiogram was performed.  The sheath was then\n removed and a new 8.5 French biliary drainage catheter (which was destrung and\n extra side holes created) was advanced over the Amplatz wire.  Contrast was\n injected confirming intraductal location of the most proximal side holes.  The\n catheter was secured to the skin using 0 silk purse-string suture and another\n 0 silk retaining suture.  The catheter was opened to an external drainage bag.\n Sterile dressings were applied.\n\n FINDINGS:\n 1.  Initial spot fluoroscopic image demonstrates indwelling metallic biliary\n stents from the prior procedure with expected unchanged position.\n 2.  Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram via right posterior ductal access\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2106-4-15**] 9:11 AM\n HEPATIC                                                         Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 83621**]\n Reason: Please perform angio for ? embolization if source of bleedin\n Admitting Diagnosis: UPPER GI BLEED\n  Contrast: VISAPAQUE Amt: 270\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n reveals widely patent indwelling stent with good flow of contrast into the\n duodenum.

Pt was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care\nUnit, placed on a PPI drip, Foley for hemodynamic monitoring and\nserial Hematocrits.  Angio was performed [**4-15**], and his GDA was\nembolized. He was transfered to the floor [**4-16**] with stable HCT.\nOn the morning of [**4-17**] he was noted to have a lower HCT and\ntachycardia with BRBPR and he was again transferred to the ICU\nfor management of an acute GI bleed. He underwent repeat EGD,\nwhich showed extensive clot in the stomach. Unable to ID source\nof bleeding, though felt to be from duodenum. He then had\nmassive UGI bleed, receiving 12u PRBC and becoming unstable. He\nthen was taken to the operating [****], where a gastrotomy\nwas created, the stents were taken out through his pylorus, and\nthe duodenum was packed with surgicel. The abdomen was left\nopen. He received 34 units perioperatively, as well as profuse\namounts of FFP and cryo. he was taken back to OR for abdominal\nclosure [**4-20**] and then was transferred back to the floor. He\nremained there with a hct in the low 30s with no transfusions x\n2 days. Of note, he was found to have enterococcus in his blood,\nand so he stayed in house on the floor to receive antibiotics.\nOn [**4-27**] there was bilious staining noted on the vac. However, a\ncholangiogram was not concerning for leak. [**4-27**] Hct was 32.8 and\nthe pt was asymptomatic all day. However, later in the evening\nhe vomited blood. At that time, his SBP was 100, HR 120 and the\nVac output became bloody from bilious. [**4-28**] he was transfered\nagain to the  SICU for hematemesis--mixed dark and bright red\nblood per mouth and rectum. An NGT was placed but unable to\nlavage due to thick stomach contents. He was monitored on Q2h\nhcts and coags and transfused 3uPRBC overnight. HDS. On [**4-29**] he\nhad 900cc of emesis (dark red blood, most likely old blood) and\nremained tachycardic, however his HCT initially remained stable\nat 28.0. Later that day he had 600cc dark bloody emesis, RBCs &\nFFP were given, trauma line was placed, and emergent endoscopy\nwas performed. This revealed grade II/III esophageal and gastric\nvarices. 10 RBC's & 8 FFP were given, as was Activated Factor\nVII was administered and he required pressors for SBP support.\nOn [**4-30**] he came off pressors, and his HCT was stable. He was\nstarted on TPN, however he required massive transfusion that\nafternoon after copious hematemesis and melena with a HCT of 15.\nHe was transfued 22U PRBC, 2FFP, 2plts, 3000mcg factor 7\n(40mcg/kg). He was scoped by GI, who placed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] - noting\npossible bleed from both GE junction and duodenum/stomach. Given\nhis worsening metabolic acidosis, increasing lactate bicarb gtt\n& phenylephrine gtt were restarted overnight. He was also\nmaintained on ARDS protocol on the vent. On [**5-1**] a family\nmeeting was held and, given the lack of surgical option and the\nintractable bleeding, the decision was made to make the pt [**Name (NI) 3225**].\nOn [**5-2**] he expired with family at the bedside and time of death\nwas called at 20:34.\n[**5-2**]: [**Month/Day (4) 3225**]\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1. amlodipine 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\n2. ursodiol 300 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times\na day).\n3. omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)

The\n patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging\n table.  The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2106-4-18**] 2:17 AM\n OTHER EMBO                                                      Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 83738**]\n Reason: identify source, embo if possible\n Admitting Diagnosis: UPPER GI BLEED\n  Contrast: VISAPAQUE Amt: 210\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.\n\n Under fluoroscopic and palpatory guidance, the right common femoral artery was\n accessed over the femoral head using a 19-gauge needle.  A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 89**] wire\n was advanced into the aorta under fluoroscopic guidance.  A 5 French [**Last Name (un) 67**]-Tip\n sheath was exchanged for the 19-gauge needle and connected to a heparin/saline\n flush.  A C2 Cobra catheter was advanced over the wire, wire removed, and the\n celiac axis selected.  The celiac axis arteriography was performed.  Next, a\n 0.035 Glide was advanced into the common hepatic artery, the catheter advanced\n and angiography performed.  Based on the results of these studies a Renegade\n Hi-[**Last Name (un) **] loaded with a combination of a 0.018 Transcend wire and a Fathom\n Steerable wire were used to advance the microcatheter into branches of the\n right hepatic artery.  Subselective angiograms were performed.  Based on the\n results a pseudoaneurysm was coiled with 0.018 2 cm x 3 mm Hilal custom coils\n and a 0.018  6 cm x 5 mm Hilal coils.  Gelfoam embolization was performed to\n near stasis.  Post-procedure common hepatic arteriography demonstrated near\n total occlusion of the pseudoaneurysm.\n\n C2 catheter was advanced into the superior mesenteric artery ostium and an\n arteriogram performed.  The catheters, wires and sheaths were removed and\n closure of the right common femoral arteriotomy site achieved with manual\n pressure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no\n immediate post-procedure complications.\n\n FINDINGS:\n 1.  Pre-procedure fluoroscopic spot image demonstrates a nasogastric tube,\n right PTBD, two stents, coils overlying the GDA and radiopaque material, Onyx\n from the previous embolization of the choledochocutaneous fistula.\n 2.  Pseudoaneurysm of a branch of the right hepatic artery, leading to likely\n bile duct opacification on selective injection.\n 3.  Post-coiling and Gelfoam embolization demonstrated near occlusion of the\n pseudoaneurysm in the proximal right hepatic artery branch.\n 4.  No extravasation seen from a superior mesenteric arteriogram.\n 5.  Blood pressure, heart rate and pulse is improved post preprocedure.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n Successful embolization of a right hepatic artery branch pseudoaneurysm using\n a combination of coils and Gelfoam.\n\n"

Opacification of the biliary tree and duodenum\n was achieved.\n\n Gravity cholangiogram demonstrated non-dilated intrahepatic ducts.  There is\n free flow of contrast through the existing tube which was patent.  The tube\n itself was positioned through the right intrahepatic ducts through the\n choledocho proximal duodenal fistula with the catheter pigtail positioned\n within the stomach.  Contrast flowed freely and quickly through the\n choledochoduodenal fistula, with preferential flow into the stomach, though\n some contrast is seen filling the second and third parts of the duodenum as\n well.  Small amount of contrast is seen pooling at the level of the\n choledochoduodenal fistula where there was a previous choledochoenteric\n connection.  However, no contrast is seen filling a choledochoenteric fistula.\n Contrast is not seen filling what is thought to be native CBD, though given\n the non-dilatation of the intrahepatic system, filling of this channel is\n unlikely.  Multiple projections were obtained which confirmed these findings.\n\n Following completion of gravity cholangiogram, the catheter was flushed and\n reattached to external bag drainage.\n\n IMPRESSION:  Gravity cholangiogram demonstrates that the internal-external\n biliary drain tip is positioned in the stomach.  The remaining anatomy and\n non-dilated intrahepatic ducts correspond to previously known findings of a\n choledochoduodenal fistula.\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2106-4-27**] 2:57 PM\n BILIARY CATH CHECK                                              Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 83739**]\n Reason: gravity cholangiogram pls.
