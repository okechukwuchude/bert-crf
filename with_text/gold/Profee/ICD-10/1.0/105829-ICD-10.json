Several EKG leads overlie the chest wall.  Patient\n is slightly rotated to the left.  The heart is normal in size.  The\n mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is plate-like\n atelectasis in the left base.  There is no pneumothorax, vascular congestion,\n or right effusion.  Trace left effusion cannot be excluded.  There is no\n subdiaphragmatic lucency to suggest pneumoperitoneum.  Bowel gas pattern is\n non-obstructive.\n\n Moderate atherosclerotic calcifications are seen involving the aortic arch and\n upper abdominal aorta.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n 1.  Left basilar atelectasis with possible trace effusion.\n 2.  Feeding tube coils within the stomach.\n 3.  No evidence of pneumoperitoneum.\n\n\n"

Three days prior to admission, the patient\ndeveloped the sudden onset of dark-colored stools. He gradually\ndeveloped nausea and vomiting with four episodes of\ncoffee-ground emesis. With regards to his prior GIB, the source\nis unknown as the family is unaware of whether the patient had\nan EGD or colonoscopy. He was recently started on an NSAID [**3-11**]\nweeks ago for a joint effusion. He developed GI upset and the\ndosing was decreased from daily to [**Hospital1 **]. He was also started on\naspirin 81 mg po daily one week ago. He has no history of\nalcohol abuse, liver disorders and is not on any\nanti-coagulation. Patient reports ongoing nausea but denies any\nfevers, chills, abdominal pain, chest pain, SOB, or dysuria. He\ndenies any dizziness or presyncope.\n.\nThe patient initially presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital ED. He was\ngiven an Octreotide bolus, Protonix bolus and was started on a\nProtonix drip. An NGT was placed which revealed coffee-ground\nemesis which cleared with NG lavage. His hemoglobin at [**Hospital **]\nHospital was 10.1, which is noted to be his baseline. On arrival\nto the [**Hospital3 **] ED, his initial VS were 96.4, 60 113/49, 14,\n99% RA. His repeat CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 9.6 and a\nleukocytosis of 15.6 with a left-shift (PMNs 84.9%) with no\nbands. A CXR did not reveal any evidence of aspiration and was\notherwise clear, and NGT was noted to be appropriately placed.\nHe was continued on the Protonix gtt and given 2 L NS. He was\nT&S for 2 units. A GI consult was called prior to transfer to\nthe MICU and they plan on EGD in the am.

Upper GI bleed: Patient admitted with hematemesis and melena\nconsistent with upper GI bleed.  Given his recent use of NSAIDS\nand aspirin, gastritis or ulcer were the most likely etiology.\nHe remained hemodynamically stable. He was initally placed on a\nPPI drip and transitioned to high dose PPI IV BID.  He underwent\nEGD; a peptic ulcer was found in the distal bulb, and this was\nclipped. He was transferred to the floor and remained stable.\nHis PPI was made PO and his home medicines were restarted. We\nheld his Aspirin and his NSAID pain medicine. He should avoid\nNSAIDs in the future. He will need to have his ASA started at\nthe discretion of his PCP.\n.\n#. Leukocytosis: UA suggestive of UTI, although he has chronic\nindwelling urostomy and no symptoms of infection. [**Month (only) 116**] also be\nsecondary to stress reaction in setting of probable GIB. CXR\nwithout infiltrate c/f pneumonia. Urine culture was negative.\nLeukocytosis resolved and was likley due to acute bleed.\n. .\n#. Positive Urinalysis/Asymptomatic Bacteriuria: Patient s/p\nbladder cancer with urostomy so has chronic indwelling biofilm\nso UA likely to be persistently positive. Culture was negative.\nNo antibiotics were given.\n.\n#. Hypertension, benign: amlodipine and nadolol were held on\nadmission. His BP normalized and his home anti-hypertensives\nwere restarted.\n.\n# Night time oxygen desaturations; Patient had several nighttime\nSaO2 values of 75% while sleeping. He was asymptomatic during\nthese events. He did not endorse symptoms to suggest sleep\napnea. Sleep was consulted and felt he did have evidence however\nan urgent inptaint sleep study was not warrented. He will be\ndischarged on night time home oxygen therapy and will follow up\nwith the sleep clinic in early [**Month (only) 404**]. In the mean time he will\nneed assistence in setting up an outpatient sleep study. His PCP\nwas called and this was communicated to him directly.\n.\n+++++++++++++++++\nTransitional issues:\n1) Consider restarting Aspirin 81 after follow up visit with\nPCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] there is no recurrent bleeding.\n2) Will need CBC and Chem 7 checked on Monday following\ndischarge by PCP (office aware). Hct 29.3 and Creatinine 1.6 on\nlast check here.\n3) Will need to have Outpatient sleep study set up, preferably\nat [**Hospital **] hospital.\n4) He was advised to avoid NSAIDs.\n.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\ndemeclocycline 150 mg po BID\nsimvastatin 10 mg po daily\nnadolol 20 mg po once a daily\namlodipine 10 mg po daily\nAricept 10 mg Once Daily\nAspirin- 81 mg po daily (started 1 week ago)\nArthrotec 75/200 1 tab [**Hospital1 **] (diclofenac/ misoprostol)\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
