The cardiac silhouette appears\n slightly increased, likely positional.  No pulmonary edema.  Slightly\n increased moderate right and small left pleural effusions.   The mediastinum\n and hila are normal.  No acute bony or soft tissue abnormalities.  A NG tube\n ends in the gastric fundus.\n There is no pneumothorax.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n Worsening of bibasilar consolidations likely consistent with worsening pleural\n effusions and aspiration pneumonia.\n\n\n"

On [**2155-6-1**] patient was\nreadmitted to the General Surgical Service with c/o\nnausea/vomiting and decreased PO intake. On admission in ED,\npatient continue to have active and continuous emesis of thin\nyellow-fluid. Patient was tachycardic with HRmax 130s, chest\nxray revealed aspiration pneumonia. Patient was intubated for\nairway protection and transferred in ICU for observation and\ntreatment.\n\nNeuro: The patient received propofol and fentanyl for sedation\nwhile intubated. After extubation, patient's pain was controlled\nwith IV Dilaudid with good effect and adequate pain control.\nWhen tolerating oral intake, the patient was transitioned to\noral pain medications. Currently patient taking Tylenol for pain\ncontrol.\n\nCV: On admission patient was tachycardic, after he was hydrated\npatient HR returned to [**Location 213**] sinus rhythm. Patient heart rate\nwas monitored with telemetry during hospitalization. The patient\nremained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; vital signs\nwere routinely monitored.\n\nPulmonary: On admission patient had active emeses, and chest xr\nrevealed aspiration pneumonia. Patient was intubated and\ntransferred in ICU. On [**6-2**] patient was extubated, he was\nrequired 3-4 L of O2 via n/c for O2 Sats > 92%. Patient was\ntransferred on the floor, where he continue to be monitored for\nO2 Sats. He continue require 2L O2, his O2 Sats 95-97%. Last\nchest pa/lat demonstrated that pulmonary edema has markedly\nimproved and now mild; bibasilar consolidations larger on the\nleft side and consistent with pneumonia; there is no\npneumothorax. Patient was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn on\nadmission, late Erythromycin was added to his treatment. Patient\ncurrently stable from pulmonary standpoint, he will continue ABX\ntreatment after discharge.\n\nGI/GU/FEN: Patient was made NPO on admission and started on TPN.\nHis diet was advanced to clears on HD # 8. Patient will continue\nTPN on discharge. His diet will be advanced slowly within 2\nweeks to fulls, with no solid food allowed until follow up with\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (Surgery). Electrolytes were routinely followed, and\nrepleted when necessary.\n\nID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were\nclosely watched for signs of infection. On admission patient's\nWBC was elevated, but currently WNL. Patient remained afebrile\nduring hospitalization. Blood, urine and sputum cultures were\nnegative.\n\nEndocrine: Patient has a history of diet controlled diabetes.\nAfter TPN was started, patient's BS was continue to increase and\nrequired increased TPN insulin, standing insulin order and high\nsliding scale for BS control. Currently patient's FS between\n90s-200s. Patient will require close blood sugar monitor when\nhis TPN will started to wean off.\n\nHematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined\nroutinely, his Hct was stable low (23.1-24.6). On [**6-5**] patient\nreceived one unit of RBC, after transfusion Hct was 24.6. On\n[**6-6**] patient received one more unit of RBC, his Hct was 29.2\nafter second transfusion. After blood transfusions, patient\nreported increase of energy and patient's O2 requirements\ndecreased from 5L to 3L.\n\nProphylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and\nvenodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get\nup and ambulate as early as possible. There was concern for a\nLUE DVT during his stay b/c of some swelling at and around the\nPICC site, but an ultrasound was performed that showed no clot\nand the swelling improved with elevation.\n\nAt the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile\nwith stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a clear\nfluid diet and TPN, ambulating with stand by assist, voiding\nwithout assistance, and pain was well controlled. The patient\nreceived discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with\nunderstanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nASA 325', norvasc 10', losartan 25', indapamide 2.5', lipitor\n10', protonix 40', reglan 10''', colace 100''prn, senna\n8.6''prn, dilaudid 2-4q4:prn, tylenol prn\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
