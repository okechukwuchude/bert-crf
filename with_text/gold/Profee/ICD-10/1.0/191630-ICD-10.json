There, EKG showed with AV pacing\nand trop found to be elevated to 0.4 (baseline per ED there is\n0.3). Got PR ASA and was sent here for ROMI/NSTEMI.\n\nOn arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED last night, pressures remained low,\nhypoxic on 3L (unclear baseline O2 requirement).  BP's were\n90/palp and pt was bradycardic to 38 (though unclear how it's\npossible given that pt is paced).  Given slightly higher trop,\nthere was initial concern for NSTEMI.  He receive 2L IVF for his\nhypotension and cardiology was consulted.  They were not\nconcerned given trop around baseline.  Unclear if EKG's were\nfaxed for them to look at.  Overnight, pressures improved with\nIVF, no antibiotics or blood cultures were drawn.  Fingersticks\ncontinued to be low 40-80 and he was started on D5 gtt at 100\ncc/hr.  BP's overnight continued to be low and this morning D5\nincreased to 150cc/hr.\n\nCT torsos (one without contrast and one with contrast) were\nobtained to look for source of hypoglycemia and found a\nlarge-moderate intussception and L3/L4 discitis.

Oral contrast in the excluded stomach and afferent limb,\nconsistent with either represent reflux secondary to obstruction\nfrom the intussusception or a fistula between the gastric\nremnant and the excluded stomach or components of both\nprocesses.\n3. Bilateral enhancing renal masses. The largest one in the left\nupper pole demonstrates interval increase in size. Findings are\nagain concerning for renal cell carcinoma.\n4. Unchanged cystic pancreatic lesions. Could be further\nassessed by MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 40806**]y indicated.\n5. Similar destructive appearance of L3-L4 compared to the prior\nL-spine CT study eight days ago. Findings again may represent\nrenal spondyloarthropathy but clinical correlation is necessary\nto exclude osteomyelitis/discitis.\n6. Similar cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis, without\nevidence of acute cholecystitis.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n70 yo M with [**Hospital 7235**] medical problems including ESRD on HD\nM/W/F, diabetes, sCHF EF 40%, HTN, HLP, borderline PD who was\nfound to be unresponsive at HD with BP 70/40 and fingerstick to\nfs 41 thought to be secondary to UTI.\n\n# Hypoglycemia: Etiology unclear. In the MICU, patient initially\nrequired D10 gtt which was then weaned off. However, several\nhours after the D10 gtt was stopped, the patient's blood sugars\ndropped back down to the 60's, ultimately requiring the D10 gtt\nto be restarted. [**Last Name (un) **] stim was unrevealing and TSH was WNL.\nPatient transferred to the floor. There remained off D10gtt\nhowever blood sugars remained labile with pre-prandial fs\nrunnning in the 70s during which patient asymptomatic. [**Last Name (un) **]\nfollowing the patient and also unclear on etiology of persistent\nhypoglycemia. Per their rec's sent C-peptide and insulin level\nwhich is still pending. He will follow up with [**Hospital 387**] clinic for\nfurther workup of this. He has had stable blood sugars for\nseveral days on the general medical floor on no anti-glycemic\nmedications.\n.\n# UTI: UA on admission grossly positive. As had history of\npseudomonal urosepsis, decision was made initially to treat with\ncefepime. However, urine cultures ultimately grew Klebsiella\nresistant to cefepime, so the patient was switched to meropenem,\nto complete a 7 day course (end date [**7-18**]). Midline placed to\nfacilitate antibiotic administration as outpatient. PICC line\nunable to be placed as subclavian thrombosed per IR. Etiology of\nrecurrent UTIs felt secondary to stasis therefore foley was\nd/c'ed with decision for QD/[**Hospital1 **] bladder scans and straight cath.\nPatient will continue to need QD/[**Hospital1 **] straight caths in future -\nand education will be needed for both patient and wife in order\nto be able to do this at home. There are also plans for him to\nfollow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] (urology) for evaluation and possible\nnephrectomy as he has a renal mass seen on multiple CT scans\n(this admission and prior) and this may keep him from making\nurine which he retains causing the frequent UTIs. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**]\nwill set him up with an appointment in the next few weeks.\n .\n#History of C.diff. In house C.diff negx2. However, given\npatient's history of severe c.diff infection and current use of\nmeropenem, ID consult service recommended treating empirically\nfor c.diff with flagyl for 14day (end date [**7-25**]).\n.\n# Hypoxia: Occurred in MICU in setting of IVF for hypotension\nand known sCHF 40% EF.  CXR with mild volume o/l. Resolved with\nHD and fluid removal. On the floor patient saturated well on RA.\n\n# Hypotension: Occurred at HD and in ED on presentation.\nPersisted in the MICU and gradually resolved with IVF and\nantibiotics likely in setting of infection. Patient\nasymptomatically hypotensive on floor with SBP ranging between\n80s-110s. Difficult to obtain accurate [**Location (un) 1131**] in HD patient.\nAnti-hypetensives were held. Occasional 250mL Boluses were given\nif SBP<80.\n\n# Intussception:  See on CT, moderate-to-large.  Surgery\nrecommended admission to medicine service for initial\nmanagement. However, surgicaly repair remained an option.\nUltimately, the decision was made to monitor patient with serial\nabdominal exam and lactate levels. Surgery was reassured with\nlactate level of 0.6. On the floor patient without pain and\ntolerating a regular diet without nausea, vomiting or pain. Plan\nto follow-up with GI as outpatient as there is concern regarding\nthe nidus for intussception ?cancer ?polyp.\n\n# Discitis:  Appears old - seen on prior imaging. Ortho spine\nand ID consulted and per imaging was not felt to be a likely\nsource of infection. In addition, nl WBC and lack of fever not\nsuggestive of active infection. Pain was managed with plan to\nfollow-up L3-L4 endplate degeneration as outpatient. Current\npain regimen has been adequately controlling his back pain for\nthe last 2 days while hospitalized.\n\n# ESRD: On HD through HD line which was changed on [**2167-6-11**].\nContinued on HD on MWF schedule. Not transplant candidate [**2-10**]\nlikely RCC. Per renal notes, question possible nephrectomy in\nthe future and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for this as above.\n\n# Diabetes: On insulin at nursing home per NH paperwork, however\ninsulin held secondary to hypoglycemia. [**Last Name (un) **] followed in house\nand will follow him as an outpatient as above.\n\n# Systolic Heart Failure: EF 40%, mild edema on CXR.\n\n# HTN: Anti-HTN meds held due to persistent asymptomatic\nhypotension.\n\n# Hyperlipidemia: Statin continued.\n\n# BPH: Home medication regimen continued\n\n# Renal Masses: High concern for RCC per out pt notes, patient\naware with plan to follow-up as outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] of\nurology.\n\n# Hypothyroidism: Thyroid medications initially held in MICU as\npatient was not taking in adequate PO.

Now repeat with oral and IV\n contrast for full evaluation.\n\n COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis on [**2167-6-7**].  Concurrent contrast CT\n abdomen and pelvis on [**2167-7-7**] at 0116 hours.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images were acquired from the lung bases to the pubic\n symphysis after administration of IV and oral contrast.  Multiplanar\n reformatted images were obtained for evaluation.\n\n CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There are bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on\n the left and small on the right.  The significant coronary artery\n calcifications are again noted.\n\n The large intussusception is at the jejunojejunal anastomosis of the gastric\n bypass is essentially unchanged compared to the non-contrast study earlier\n today.  Contrast is noted in the afferent limb and the excluded stomach,\n either representing reflux from intussusception obstruction or a fistula from\n the gastric remnant to the excluded stomach with opacification of both limbs\n (or contribution of both).  Distention of small bowel proximal to the site of\n intussusception is consistent with partial obstruction, although small amount\n of oral contrast is seen passing distally beyond the intussusception point on\n to the distal jejunum.  Marked bowel wall edema is noted with the\n intussuscepted bowel.  Mesenteric vessels coursing within the intussuscepted\n segment opacify with contrast and there is no definite evidence of ischemia of\n the intussuscepted loop although the presence of oral contrast about the loop\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2167-7-7**] 6:02 AM\n CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST                     Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 50276**]\n Reason: assessment of intussception?\n Admitting Diagnosis: HYPOTENSION\n  Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 130\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n somewhat limits assessment for mural enhancement.\n\n The liver is noted with several punctate hypoenhancing lesions, too small to\n be fully evaluated.  The liver is otherwise normal without intrahepatic\n biliary ductal dilatation.  Multiple hypodense lesions are again noted in the\n spleen, with the largest one measuring 11 mm in diameter (image 2:14),\n nonspecific.  The moderately distended gallbladder is noted with two\n gallstones layering in the dependent position.  There is no fat stranding to\n suggest acute inflammatory process.  A punctate hyperdensity in the CBD is\n unchanged, and likely represents a small choledocholithiasis.  The pancreas is\n again noted with multiple cystic lesions with the largest one in the\n pancreatic tail measuring 12 mm (image 2:26), similar in appearance compared\n to prior.  The adrenal glands are normal.\n\n Again noted are bilateral enhancing renal lesions.  The largest one is noted\n in the left upper pole (image 2:30), measuring 30 x 23 mm, slightly larger\n than the prior and now has extension to the renal sinus medially.  The smaller\n one in the left kidney is noted in the left lower pole, measuring 11 x 8 mm\n (image 2:35) similar in size from prior study.  There is a probably-enhancing\n lesion in the right lower pole measures 29 x 25 mm (image 2:45).  All of these\n lesions are concerning for renal cell carcinoma.  A hyperdense cyst in the\n right lower pole (image 2:44), measures 30-mm in diameter.  There is no\n hydronephrosis.\n\n No significant free fluid is noted in the abdomen.  There are small mesenteric\n lymph nodes, but none of them are pathologically enlarged.\n\n CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder wall is mildly thickened.  The\n patient is reportedly anuric and there is no excreted IV contrast in the\n bladder.  The colon is unremarkable.  There is no significant ascites in the\n pelvis.  No free air or lymphadenopathy is noted.  Again seen are significant\n vascular calcifications involving all major branches of the abdominal\n vasculature.  There is moderate generalized anasarca throughout the abdominal\n and pelvic wall.\n\n BONE WINDOW:  The destructive changes at the endplates of L3-L4 demonstrate no\n significant interval change compared to the prior CT lumbar spine study on\n [**2167-6-29**].  This could represent osteomyelitis/discitis or accelerated\n renal spondyloarthropathy.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n 1.  Persistent jejunojejunal intussusception at the distal anastomosis with\n marked bowel wall edema in the intussuscepted bowel and partial small bowel\n obstruction.\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2167-7-7**] 6:02 AM\n CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST                     Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 50276**]\n Reason: assessment of intussception?\n Admitting Diagnosis: HYPOTENSION\n  Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 130\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n\n 2.

Bilateral enhancing renal masses.  The largest one in the left upper pole\n demonstrates interval increase in size.  Findings are again concerning for\n renal cell carcinoma.\n\n 4.  Unchanged cystic pancreatic lesions.  Could be further assessed by MR [**First Name (Titles) **]\n[**Last Name (Titles) 50277**] indicated.\n\n 5.

Recommend clinical correlation.\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n HISTORY:  70-year-old male, presents with hypotension, hypoglycemia from\n dialysis.  Rule out large intra-abdominal abscess or other abdominal\n catastrophe.\n\n COMPARISON:  None.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast MDCT images were acquired from the lung bases to the\n pubic symphysis without either IV or oral contrast.  Multiplanar reformatted\n images were obtained for evaluation.\n\n CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  In the visualized lung bases, there are\n bilateral simple pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the\n left.  There are significant coronary calcifications in all visualized\n coronary arteries.  Dual-chamber pacemaker leads terminating in the right\n atrium and right ventricle, respectively.  Moderate aortic and mitral valvular\n calcifications are noted.  There is no significant pericardial effusion.\n\n The absence of IV contrast significantly limits evaluation of the\n intra-abdominal organs.  There are marked vascular calcifications in all major\n intra-abdominal vessels.  The liver is grossly normal without focal lesions.\n There are two gallstones layering in the dependent portion of a distended\n gallbladder.  Lack of IV contrast also limits evaluation of potential\n gallbladder wall thickening.\n\n There is a 12-mm hypodense lesion within the anterior aspect of the spleen,\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2167-7-7**] 1:06 AM\n CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST                 Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 50273**]\n Reason: non-con.  r/o large intra-abdominal abscess, other abd catas\n Field of view: 44\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n non-specific, could represent a pseudocyst from prior trauma.  The adrenal\n glands and pancreas are grossly unremarkable.  There are bilateral renal cysts\n with the largest one in the right lower pole, exophytic and measuring 32 mm in\n diameter (image 300B:37). There is no hydronephrosis, hydroureter, or renal\n stone.\n\n In the left upper quadrant, there is a large entero-enteric intussusception,\n with the mesenteric fat telescoped into the bowel lumen.  The affected area\n measures approximately 9.8 x 5.9 x 7.9 cm (image 2:41 and 300B:32).  There has\n been prior gastric bypass and this is located at the distal entero-enteric\n anastomosis.\n\n A hiatal hernia is small.  The remainder portion of the small bowel is\n unremarkable.\n\n There is a small amount of free fluid in the intra-abdominal cavity and\n diffuse stranding of the abdominal wall consistent with anasarca.  Small\n mesenteric lymph nodes are not pathologically enlarged.  No free air is noted.\n\n CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Marked fecal load is seen throughout the colon.\n The urinary bladder wall is mildly thickened, non-specific, but could\n represent chronic bladder outflow obstruction.  There is a small amount of\n free fluid pooling in the right lower quadrant/deep pelvis.\n Moderate-to-severe diffuse anasarca is noted throughout the abdominal and\n pelvic wall.\n\n BONE WINDOWS:  The patient has markedly degenerative changes throughout the\n spine.  Irregular endplate erosion at L3-4, with appearance of widening of the\n intervertebral disc space, is new from prior abdominopelvic CT of [**2167-4-25**] but unchanged from dedicated multiple CTs of lumbar spine most recently\n of [**2167-6-29**], and again may represent noninfective spondyloarthropathy\n although infectious process such as osteomyelitis or intervertebral abscess\n cannot be entirely excluded.  There is otherwise no worrisome lytic or\n sclerotic lesions for malignancy.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n 1.  Prior gastric bypass surgery with enteroenteric intussusception in the\n left upper quadrant at the distal anastomosis.  No evidence of proximal\n dilation of bowel to suggest obstruction at the time of the examination but\n correlation with physical examination is recommended.\n\n 2.  Destructive change of L3-4 endplates with appearance of widening of\n intervertebral space, unchanged from CT of lumbar spine of [**2167-6-29**], may\n again represent noninfective spondyloarthropathy although superimposed\n infection (discitis/osteomyelitis) cannot be entirely excluded and clinical\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2167-7-7**] 1:06 AM\n CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST                 Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 50273**]\n Reason: non-con.  r/o large intra-abdominal abscess, other abd catas\n Field of view: 44\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n correlation is necessary.\n\n 3.

PICC placement too difficult at\n  bedside.\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n INDICATION:  70-year-old man with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis,\n diabetes, CHF, hypertension and discitis, admitted for complication of\n urosepsis.  Pre-existing hemodialysis line on the right and central IJ on\n left.  For PICC placement, too difficult at bedside.\n\n RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 596**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 192**], the\n attending radiologist, was present and supervised throughout.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, the\n left brachial vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a\n micropuncture set.  Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and\n immediately after establishing intravenous access.  A 0.018 guidewire was\n advanced into the left subclavian vein, but stopped more proximally.  A 0.018\n nitinol and angled Glidewire were used in an attempt to pass this obstructed\n area into the SVC.  These attempts failed.  Next, a 5 French 40-cm Kumpe\n catheter was advanced and a 0.016 Headliner used attempt to pass this\n apparently occluded area.  This was unsuccessful.  Injection of contrast\n indicated occlusion of the more proximal SVC with contrast seen in the azygos\n system.  The fluoro team was consulted and representative for Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2622**]\n indicated that a midline would be sufficient for the medical needs of the\n patient.  Therefore, a peel-away sheath was placed over a guidewire and a PICC\n line measuring 26 cm in length placed through the peel-away sheath with its\n tip positioned in the mid subclavian vein under fluoroscopic guidance.\n Position of the catheter was confirmed by fluoroscopic spot film of the chest.\n The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed.  The catheter was\n secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.  The patient\n tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.\n\n IMPRESSION:  Complicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically left double-lumen\n PICC line placement via the left brachial venous approach.  There is apparent\n occlusion of the proximal subclavian vein at its confluence with the SVC.\n Final internal PICC length is 26 cm with the tip positioned in the subclavian\n vein.  The line is ready to use.\n\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2167-7-14**] 2:32 PM\n PICC LINE PLACMENT SCH                                          Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 50278**]\n Reason: Has HD line on right and Central IJ on left.
