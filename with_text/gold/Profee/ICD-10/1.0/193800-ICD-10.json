Therapeutic Hypothermia: Pt had a cardiac arrest of unclear\n   etiology, although may be related to a high cervical spine injury since\n   pt has evidence of a dens fracture on CT scan. Induction of hypothermia\n   carries a theoretical risk of coagulopathy and while this pat sustained\n   trauma, there is currently no evidence of active hemorrhage. However,\n   in discussion with the attending trauma surgeon, there is a concern for\n   the possibility of delayed bleeding around site of cord injury if the\n   pt becomes coagulopathic; therefore, will defer cooling for now,\n   pending MRI of spine. If MRI is negative for cord edema, this issue\n   could be revisited, although pt is now at least 5 hours out from\n   initial arrest.\n   2.       Avoid elevated ICP:\n   -          HOB > 30 degrees\n   -          Maintain normocarbia goal pCO2 35-40\n   3.       Monitor for seizure activity:\n                  -      Continuous EEG x 48 hrs\n                  -       If sz activity on EEG, treat with benzos/AEDs as\n   per Neurology recs\n                  -       Neurology ICU/Epilepsy consult for EEG\n   interpretation, prognosis\n   We will continue to follow with primary team, please call/page with\n   questions.\n   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 963**], MD\n   EM/CCM  Fellow\n   Pager [**Numeric Identifier 8744**]\n"

Normal IVC diameter\n(<2.1cm) with >55% decrease during respiration (estimated RA pressure\n(0-5mmHg).\n\nLEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Mild global LV\nhypokinesis. No resting LVOT gradient.\n\nRIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Borderline normal RV systolic\nfunction.\n\nAORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.\n\nAORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Trace AR.\n\nMITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. Mild mitral\nannular calcification.\n\nTRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to moderate [[**2-10**]+] TR.\nMild PA systolic hypertension.\n\nPULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized. No PS.\nPhysiologic PR.\n\nPERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.\n\nConclusions:\nThe left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. The\nestimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses\nand cavity size are normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis\n(LVEF = 45%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal\nfree wall function. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.\nThe ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear\nstructurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal\nwith trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic\nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild global left ventricular hypokinesis\nwithout regional dysfunction.. Dilated ascending aorta.\n\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:\nBased on [**2145**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings\nindicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical decisions regarding the need\nfor prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.\n\n\n"

Per witnesses report, the patient was riding his\n   bike with a helmet at a low speed and hit a pot hole; he did not lose\n   consciousness, but stood up and then suddenly collapsed. Per witnesses,\n   patient was initially\n   unresponsive but with a pulse. Upon EMS arrival, he arrested; CPR was\n   started, and a pulse was regained. However the patient went into\n   cardiac arrest again. He was pulseless and non-breathing for\n   approximately 5-10 minutes. ACLS protocol was started and a pulse was\n   found. In ED, he remains intubated, in NSR and on norepi for blood\n   pressure. Found to have Acute type 2 dens fracture. Admitted to TICU\n   for further management.\n   Other medications:\n   1.

Mediastinum is distorted due to the rotation.  There is\n interval resolution of the left upper lobe opacity which probably represents\n an atelectatic left upper lobe.  There is mild increase in the right lung\n interstitial opacities with Kerley B lines, which may represent positional\n effect of pulmonary edema affecting the right lung.  There is diffuse decrease\n in the translucency of the right lung, representing a right pleural effusion.\n Bibasilar atelectasis is otherwise unchanged.  Interval improvement in the\n right upper lobe atelectasis.\n\n An endotracheal tube is in standard position terminating 6 cm from the carina.\n Left subclavian line terminates at the upper SVC.  There is no evidence of\n pneumothorax.\n\n IMPRESSION:  Interval resolution of the left upper lobe opacity suggests left\n upper lobe collapse as a likely etiology for the opacity in the prior study.\n Stable bibasilar atelectasis with minimal interval improvement in the right\n upper lobe atelectasis.\n\n\n"

There is associated disruption of the\n anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments.  There is also edema in the\n interspinous ligament at C1-2, extending into the posterior paravertebral soft\n tissues.  There is high T2 signal and swelling in the spinal cord at the level\n of C2 and the dens, consistent with acute edema.  While the dens fracture\n fragment is slightly retropulsed relative to the body of [**Name (NI) 267**], no significant\n narrowing of the spinal canal is seen.  There is a very small epidural\n hematoma posterior to the body of the dens, measuring 1.5 mm in thickness\n (image 3:10).\n\n Degenerative changes are present from C3-4, C6-7, with mild-to-moderate\n narrowing of the neural foramina due to uncovertebral and facet osteophytes.\n No significant spinal canal stenosis is seen.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n 1.

Opacification in the right lobe is likely\n atelectasis from the occluded upper lobe bronchus.  Retrocardiac opacification\n suggests perisistent atelectasis worse in the right parasagital area.  There\n is no large effusion or pneumothorax.  Bowel loops remain distended.\n\n COMMENT:  These results were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2609**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14719**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1238**]\n [**Name (STitle) 1239**] at 2:10 p.m.\n\n"

Evaluate for internal injuries.\n\n TECHNIQUE:\n MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images through the chest, abdomen,\n and pelvis following the administration of 130 cc Optiray IV contrast.\n Delayed imaging through the kidneys was also performed.  Coronal and sagittal\n reformations were provided.\n\n FINDINGS:\n\n CHEST:  An endotracheal tube is seen with its tip approximately 4.6 cm above\n the carina.  The tip of the NG tube is seen within the distal esophagus.\n Please note, the proximal NG tube is coiled in the oropharynx (seen on the\n concurrently performed CT cervical spine).  The mediastinal great vessels\n opacify normally.  There is a moderate amount of atherosclerotic calcification\n noted along the aortic arch.  There is dense calcification along the coronary\n arteries.  The heart is normal in size.  There is no pericardial effusion.  No\n lymphadenopathy.\n\n Dense consolidation is seen within the posterior lungs bilaterally with\n scattered air bronchograms most compatible with sequelae of aspiration.  There\n is no pneumothorax, hemothorax or evidence of lung contusion.\n\n ABDOMEN:  Streak artifact from a metallic EKG lead overlying the upper abdomen\n and right lung base somewhat limits evaluation through the liver dome.  Within\n the liver dome in segment VIII, there is patchy hypoattenuation which may\n reflect abnormal perfusion as the appearance is unusual for contusion.  There\n is no evidence of liver laceration or perihepatic fluid.  There is mild\n periportal edema, likely reflecting volume resuscitation.  The gallbladder is\n normal.  The spleen is intact.  Adrenal glands are unremarkable.  The right\n kidney is intact with parapelvic cysts noted.  The kidneys enhance\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2147-12-18**] 11:14 AM\n CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST                      Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 27045**]\n CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST\n Reason: trauma\n  Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 130\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n symmetrically.  Along the left renal pelvis/ureteropelvic junction, there is a\n small amount of hematoma which surrounds the collecting system.  There is no\n contrast extravasation on the delayed images to suggest urinary tract\n disruption.  The source of this hematoma/bleeding is unclear, and the\n possibility of a parapelvic cyst rupture is considered.  There is no renal\n laceration or evidence of parenchymal injury.\n\n The abdominal aorta contains scattered atherosclerotic calcifications though\n is normal in caliber and major branch vessels appear widely patent.  There is\n no lymphadenopathy.\n\n The stomach and duodenum appear grossly unremarkable.\n\n PELVIS:  Loops of small bowel appear slightly prominent and gas-distende\n though there is no evidence of obstruction.  Large bowel contains a large\n amount of fecal material.  The appendix is normal.  Urinary bladder contains a\n Foley catheter.  The prostate gland measures 5.1 cm in transverse dimension.\n No free fluid is seen in the pelvis. Pelvic vessels contain scattered\n atherosclerotic calcification.\n\n BONE WINDOWS:  Acute left-sided rib fractures are seen involving the left\n second anterior rib, and anterolateral arch of the left 3 - 7th ribs  Old\n right-sided rib cage deformities are seen.  Vertebral body heights are\n preserved.  Schmorl's node likely result in concavity along the L2 superior\n endplate.  Degenerative change in the lumbar spine with facet arthropathy is\n noted.  The sternum is intact.  Bony pelvis appears intact.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n 1.  Small hematoma along the left renal pelvis/UPJ without evidence of urinary\n tract disruption.\n\n 2.  Bilateral posterior lung consolidations likely reflect the sequelae of\n aspiration.\n\n 3.  Malpositioned NG tube with tip at the level of the distal esophagus.\n Recommendation for repositioning has been discussed with the trauma team.\n\n 4.  Extensive atherosclerotic calcification along the coronary arteries.\n\n 5.  Multiple left-sided rib fractures as detailed above.\n\n 6.  Heterogeneous perfusion along the dome of the liver likely reflects\n abnormal perfusion and may be related to volume resuscitation and asystolic\n arrest.  Clinical correlation is advised.  No abnormality seen in this region\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2147-12-18**] 11:14 AM\n CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST                      Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 27045**]\n CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST\n Reason: trauma\n  Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 130\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n on the delayed imaging.\n\n These findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 776**] and remainder of the trauma\n team at the time of initial review.\n\n"

Per witnesses report, the patient was riding his\n   bike with a helmet at a low speed and hit a pot hole; he did not lose\n   consciousness, but stood up and then suddenly collapsed. Per witnesses,\n   patient was initially\n   unresponsive but with a pulse. Upon EMS arrival, he arrested; CPR was\n   started, and a pulse was regained. However the patient went into\n   cardiac arrest again. He was pulseless and non-breathing for\n   approximately 5-10 minutes. ACLS protocol was started and a pulse was\n   found. In ED, he remains intubated, in NSR and on norepi for blood\n   pressure. Found to have Acute type 2 dens fracture. Admitted to TICU\n   for further management.\n   Other medications:\n   1.
