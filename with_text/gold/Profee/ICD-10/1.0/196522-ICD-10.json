The\nleft ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left\nventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular\nsystolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are complex\n(>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in\nthe descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)\nappear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no\naortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nPost Bypass: Patient is A paced, on phenylepherine infusion.\nPreserved biventricular function. LVEF 55%. MR is now trace.\nAortic contours intact. Remaining exam is unchanged. All\nfindings discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.\n  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance\nwith HCFA regulations.\n\nInterpretation assigned to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD, Interpreting\nphysician\n\nCardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2150-4-3**]  2:08:28 PM\n\n\nSinus rhythm.

See operative report\nfor further details.  He received cefazolin for perioperative\nantibiotics.  Post operatively he was transferred to the\nintensive care unit for management.  In the first twenty four\nhours he was weaned from sedation, awoke, and was extubated\nwithout complications.  He continued to do well and was\ntransferred to the floor.  His percocet was stopped due to\nconfusion which resolved.  Physical therapy worked with him on\nstrength and mobility.

Elongated LA. No thrombus in the LAA.\n\nRIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.\n\nLEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size. Normal\nregional LV systolic function. Low normal LVEF.\n\nRIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.\n\nAORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Focal calcifications in ascending\naorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic\narch. Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.\n\nAORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.

No TEE related\ncomplications.\n\nConclusions:\nPost Bypass: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left\nventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is\nnormal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF\n50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There\nare complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in\nthe descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear\nstructurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation\nis seen. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nPost Bypass: Patient is A paced, on phenylepherine infusion. Preserved\nbiventricular function. LVEF 55%. MR is now trace. Aortic contours intact.\nRemaining exam is unchanged. All findings discussed with surgeons at the time\nof the exam.\n\n\n"
