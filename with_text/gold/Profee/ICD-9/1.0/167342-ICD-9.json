Gating on\nthese cells demonstrates that these cells express immature\nantigens CD34, HLA-DR, and TdT, lymphoid associated antigens\nCD10, CD19 and CD20 along with CD71. They lack surface\nimmunoglobulin light chains kappa and lambda. They lack\nT-associated antigens (CD3, CD5, CD2, CD7, CD4, CD8) and are\nnegative for myeloid associated antigens CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33,\nCD117, CD11c, CD41, CD56, CD64 and Glycophorin A.\n\nCD45 bright lymphocytes comprise 24% of total analyzed events.\nB cells comprise 18% of lymphoid-gated events, are polyclonal,\nand do not express aberrant antigens.

Please correlate with\ncytogenetic findings (see separate report).\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION\nPeripheral Blood Smear:\n\nThe smear is adequate for evaluation. Erythrocytes appear mildly\ndecreased in number, are normochromic with rare dacryocytes,\nechinocytes, fragments,  microcytes and nucleated red blood\ncells noted. The white blood cell count appears mildly\nincreased.  A majority of circulating cells are variably sized,\nwith moderately condensed to open chromatin, prominent nuclei,\nround to slightly irregular nuclear contours, scant amounts of\nbasophilic cytoplasm and occasional coarse granules.  Platelet\ncount appears significantly decreased.  Differential shows 12%\nneutrophils, 20% lymphocytes, 68% Blasts.\nAspirate Smear:\n\nThe aspirate material is not submitted due to dry tap.\nTouch Imprints:\n\nTouch imprints are adequate for evaluation. The smears are\nhypercellular with sheets of small to medium sized cells, with\nscant cytoplasm, smooth chromatin, prominent nucleoli and\nslightly irregular nuclear contours, morphologically consistent\nwith blasts\nClot Section and Biopsy Slides:\n\nThe biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and consists of\ntwo bone marrow core biopsies composed of trabecular bone with\nbone marrow elements, the overall cellularity is more than 95%\nand consists almost entirely of a monotonous population of\nvariably-sized cells with round to regular nuclei, open\nchromatin and scant amount of cytoplasm.  Occasional atypical\nmitoses are seen in the neoplastic cells.  Rare scattered\nmyeloid precursors, plasma cells and small erythroid islands are\nseen.\n\nBCR-ABL: Normal, see cytogenetics report for full description\n\nTTE [**8-16**] The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular\nwall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic\nfunction are normal (LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests\na normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The\nright ventricular cavity appears small, with normal free wall\ncontractility. There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the aortic\narch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic\nregurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with\ntrivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.\nThe estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.\n\nImpression: Suboptimal image quality. The right atrium and, to a\nlesser extent, the right ventricle appear extrinsically\ncompressed. However, due to the technically suboptimal nature of\nthe acquired images, neither cardiac tamponade secondary to a\nloculated pericardial effusion nor a soft tissue mass causing\nright heart compression can be excluded on the basis of this\nstudy. A cardiac CT scan or MRI is recommended for further\nimaging of this abnormality.\n\nCT chest [**8-16**]: IMPRESSION:\n\n1. Ascending, arch and descending thoracic aorta is normal in\nmorphology\nwithout any element of calcification\n\n2. No CT evidence of an extrinsic compression on the\natrium/right ventricle.\n\n3. No pulmonary embolism\n\n4. Focal opacity in the right upper lobe may represent either\ninfectious focus\nor could be inflammatory give the clinical setting.\n\n5. Mild splenomegaly\n\nEKG [**8-17**]: Afib with RVR\n\n[**8-16**] Echocardiogram: Impression: Suboptimal image quality. The\nright atrium and, to a lesser extent, the right ventricle appear\nextrinsically compressed. However, due to the technically\nsuboptimal nature of the acquired images, neither cardiac\ntamponade secondary to a loculated pericardial effusion nor a\nsoft tissue mass causing right heart compression can be excluded\non the basis of this study. A cardiac CT scan or MRI is\nrecommended for further imaging of this abnormality.\n\nCSF:\n[**2131-8-18**] 03:38PM CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) WBC-1 RBC-7* Polys-0\nLymphs-56 Monos-44\n[**2131-8-18**] 03:38PM CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) TotProt-20 Glucose-62\nLD(LDH)-17\n[**2131-9-1**] 07:01PM CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) WBC-1 RBC-1* Polys-2\nLymphs-62 Monos-36\n\n[**8-18**] immunophenotyping of CSF:\nNo aberrant cells are identified in this specimen using a\nlimited marker panel.\n\nDue to paucicellularity the findings need to be interpreted with\ncaution.

She was transferred to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **]\nMedical Center for initiation of care.\n\nAcute Care:\n\n1. ALL: Patient had symptoms of night sweats, easy bruising,\nfatigue and initially chest pain and was diagnosed with ALL at\nOSH via flow cytometry. At our hospital the diagnosis was\nconfirmed via biopsy and flow cytometry, which were consistent\nwith pre-B cell ALL negative for the [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome.\nShe underwent induction chemotherapy under experimental protcol\n#06-254 ALL Adult Consortium trial.  The protocol included PO\nprednisone, and IV doxorubicin, cytarabine, vincristine, and\nmethotrexate. She also received intrathecal methotrexate,\ncytarabine, and hydrocortisone. The protocol included\nasparaginase as well. She tolerated it well with slight\nintermittant symptoms of headache, throat pain and nausea.\nActivated AT and fibrinogen levels were monitored and remained\nwithin normal limits. She received enoxaparin for DVT\nprophylaxis, and zofran and compazine for nausea. She was given\nacyclovir and fluconazole for infection prophylaxis while\nneutropenic and received a 10-day course of IV cefepime for\nfever on admission that was culture-negative. Patient's\nneutrophil count dropped with therapy but recovered. She was\ndischarged on day 20 of the protocol having regained her cell\ncounts to a granulocyte count of 1205. She was instructed to\nfollow up on day 22 next for IV vincristine\n\n2. Atrial fibrillation: Patient experienced new onset atrial\nfibrillation with RVR in the hospital after a placement of a\ncentral line. CT showed potential area of leukemic infiltrate in\nthe right mediastinum. Patient's line  was changed over the\nwire, as irritation from the line was a likely explaination for\natrial fibrillation. She went to the ICU where she was placed on\na diltiazem drip. She converted to sinus rhythm following. He\nhome adderall was held.\n\nChronic Care:\n\n1. Asthma: Patient was continued on home albuterol inhaler prn.\n\n2. ADHD: Adderall was held because of its potential to cause\narryhthmias, and will be restarted as an oupatient when risk is\nlower for arrythmias.\n\n3. Depression: Patient was continued on home venlafaxine.\n\nTransitions in Care:\nPatient was given a follow-up appointment 2 days post-discharge\nfor IV chemotherapy and blood work, and given an appointment on\n[**2131-9-14**] for further chemo and BM biopsy. She was instructed to\nstop taking Lovenox >24 hours before the procedure. She will\nneed weekly AT and fibrinogen levels drawn.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nAlbuterol prn\nAdderall 30 mg [**Hospital1 **]\nvenlafaxine XR 75 mg qday\nibuprofen prn\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. prednisone 10 mg Tablet Sig: 4.5 Tablets PO BID (2 times a\nday) for 10 days.\nDisp:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n2. acyclovir 400 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a\nday).\nDisp:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n3. enoxaparin 40 mg/0.4 mL Syringe Sig: One (1) unit\nSubcutaneous DAILY (Daily): Last day is day 26 ([**2131-9-12**]).\nDisp:*13 unit* Refills:*0*\n4. cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1)\nTablet PO DAILY (Daily).\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n5. omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)

Contiguous axial images at 2.5-mm slice thickness were\n reviewed concurrently with coronal and sagittal reformats. Study is\n technically inadequate to evaluate subsegmental arteries because of suboptimal\n opacification.\n\n FINDINGS\n\n PULMONARY ARTERIES:  The caliber of main pulmonary artery proximal to\n bifurcation is 24 mm and is normal.  There are no filling defects within the\n main,lobar and segmental branches of pulmonary artery.  Evaluation of\n subsegmental arteries was suboptimal because of the inadequate opacification.\n\n LUNGS:  Bilateral simple pleural effusions are mild with atelectasis of the\n adjacent lungs.  There is a focal opacity in the right upper lobe (3:7) and in\n the given clinical setting is suspicious for infectious focus or could be\n nonspecific inflammation This needs attention on followup imaging.\n\n MEDIASTINUM:  The ascending aorta, aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta\n is normal in morphology without any element of calcification.  No extrinsic\n compression is seen on the atrium or the ventricle.  Heart is normal size\n without pericardial effusion.  The distal end of the right subclavian line is\n ending into the left brachiocephalic just before the origin of the SVC.\n\n ABDOMEN:  The study is not tailored for evaluation of the abdomen; however,\n unremarkable except for mild splenomegaly.\n\n BONES:  There is no bone lesion suspicious for malignancy or infection.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n 1. Ascending, arch and descending thoracic aorta is normal in morphology\n without any element of calcification\n\n 2. No CT evidence of an extrinsic compression on the atrium/right ventricle.\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2131-8-16**] 2:59 PM\n CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY                          Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 23244**]\n Reason: Please evaluate ? atheroma in the aorta; also ? loculated pe\n Admitting Diagnosis: LEUKEMIA\n  Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt:\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n\n 3.

TDI E/e' < 8, suggesting normal PCWP (<12mmHg).\nNo resting LVOT gradient.\n\nRIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen. Small RV cavity. Normal RV systolic\nfunction.\n\nAORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal ascending aorta\ndiameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Complex (mobile) atheroma in the aortic\narch.\n\nAORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.\n\nMITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. No MVP. Normal\nmitral valve supporting structures. No MS. Normal LV inflow pattern for age.\n\nTRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Normal tricuspid valve\nsupporting structures. No TS. Mild [1+] TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.\n\nPULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet. No PS.\nPhysiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA\n\nGENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows. Suboptimal\nimage quality - body habitus.\n\nConclusions:\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity\nsize and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%). Tissue\nDoppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure\n(PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity appears small, with normal free\nwall contractility. There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the aortic arch.\nThe aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve\nappears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no\nmitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is\nnormal.\n\nImpression: Suboptimal image quality. The right atrium and, to a lesser\nextent, the right ventricle appear extrinsically compressed. However, due to\nthe technically suboptimal nature of the acquired images, neither cardiac\ntamponade secondary to a loculated pericardial effusion nor a soft tissue mass\ncausing right heart compression can be excluded on the basis of this study. A\ncardiac CT scan or MRI is recommended for further imaging of this abnormality.\n\n\n"
