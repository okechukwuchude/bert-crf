An NG-type tube is present,\n tip extending beneath diaphragm overlying stomach.  A right IJ central line is\n present, clip near cavoatrial junction.  There is volume loss on the right,\n with slight rightward shift of the mediastinum, unchanged.  Again seen is\n cardiomegaly with a prominent left pulmonary artery.  Opacification in the\n right lung, denser around the periphery and prominent vessels at the left\n base, likely associated with atelectasis.  No left effusion.  No pneumothorax\n detected.  There is negligible aeration visible in the right mainstem\n bronchus.  Known right apical scarring noted.  Probable pulmonary\n hypertension.  The previously demonstrated hernia not well appreciated on this\n film.\n\n"

On\nthe day prior to presentation ([**2161-5-15**]) he was noted to be tired\nand weak, and he fell. He has not complained of respiratory\nsymtpoms. Overnight at 0100 he dropped to below 90% and placed\non 2LNC. He had respiratory distress, was given nebulizer and\ntylenol without improvement. Later, his O2 sat dropped to 70 on\n2L, and he was switched to NRB with 15L, then 96%. Temp was\n99.6, given albuterol, but respirations increased to 37.

Also found\nto have VRE bacteremia for which he was started on 14 days of\nLinezolid.\n.\n# Acute respiratory distress/Healthcare Associated Pneumonia:\nPresentation with dyspnea, fever, bandemia, hypoxia, and CXR\nfindings all consistent with acute pneumonia. Given his\nresidence at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, he was started on Vancomycin,\nCefepime, and Levofloxacin. TB felt unlikely given the rapid\nacuity of symptoms and lack of other more subacute\nconstitutional symptoms. Moreover, patient had documented\nadequate treatment of latent TB (with negative CXR) in [**2153**].\nAdditional processes, such as pulmonary embolism, seemed\nunlikely given his therapeutic INR. Patient was treated with\nBipap and appeared to improve, but on hospital day #2, he was\ntachypneic to the 30s, somnolent and working very hard to breath\nso he was intubated and placed on ARDS net ventilation. Once\nstable he was 12L positive and diuresis with IV Lasix was\ninitiated. He responded well to Lasix 20mg IV and was extubated\non [**5-19**] without complication. Diuresis was continued until his\nvolume status was optimized. An echocardiogram showed normal\nsystolic function. He completed a 7 day course of broad\nantibiotics.\n.\n# Severe sepsis: Patient presented with pneumosepsis and\nelevated lactate up to 9.  His lactate trended down to 2 after\n6L IVF in the ED.  His pressures maintained MAP >60 until the\npatient was intubated when he became hypotensive.  A central\nline was placed and he was started on Levophed. He was given\nbolus fluids for CVP <10 and weaned off pressors. He was put on\nVanc/Levo/Cef for presumed HAP. He did have BCx positive for\nGPCs after resolution of sepsis, which were ultimately speciated\nto VRE (Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus). His central venous\ncatheter was removed. He was started on a 14 days course of PO\nLinezolid 600 mg twice daily, which should continue until\n[**2161-6-3**]. Surveillence blood cultures have shown no growth to\ndate. These are still pending and should be followed up on.\n.\n# Delerium: Likely secondary to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy\nfrom infection in a patient with underlying dementia. We\nattempted to minimize unecessary lines and tubes, provide\nfrequent orientation, and avoid aggravating\nmedications/sedatives.\n.\n# Atrial fibrillation: Rate controlled without medications. On\nCoumadin for anticoagulation. His INR was elevated at 3 (likely\nsecondary to antibiotics and poor nutrition), so Coumadin has\nbeen held at discharge. His INR should be monitored and Coumadin\nre-started once necessary.\n.\n# BPH/Urinary Obstruction: Tamsulosin held on admission during\nsevere sepsis, but re-started upon transfer to the floor. The\npatient self-discontinued his foley and had subsequent traumatic\ninjury resulting in blood clots that would cause painful\nobstruction. A foley was placed and will need to remain until he\nis healed and a voiding trial can be attempted. Frequent\nirrigation should be provided to prevent blood clots.\n.\n# [**Last Name (un) **]: Mild, but eGFR of 40 on admission with elevated BUN.\nCreatinine improved from 1.1 to 0.8 after IVF resuscitation in\nthe MICU, but increased after diuresis. 1.2 at discharge, which\nshould be monitored in the future.\n.\n# Suspected COPD: Patient continued on nebulizer treatement.\n.\n# Microcytic Anemia: Remained relatively stable throughout the\nadmission.

Normal interatrial\nseptum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler. Increased IVC diameter (>2.1cm) with\n<35% decrease during respiration (estimated RA pressure (10-20mmHg).\n\nLEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and regional/global\nsystolic function (LVEF>55%). No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.\n\nRIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.\n\nAORTA: Mildy dilated aortic root.

The aortic valve leaflets\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic\nregurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric. The mitral\nvalve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The\ntricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery\nsystolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of\n[**2156-9-9**], no major change.\n\n\n"
