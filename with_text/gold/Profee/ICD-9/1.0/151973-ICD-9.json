The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial\nseptal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild\nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size\nand global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left\nventricular wall motion is normal. There is no ventricular\nseptal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated\nwith normal free wall contractility. There is abnormal septal\nmotion/position. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The\naortic valve is not well seen. There is no aortic valve\nstenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve\nleaflets are not well seen. No mitral regurgitation is seen.\nTricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. The\npulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.\nThere is an anterior space which most likely represents a\nprominent fat pad.\n\nCXR [**2125-11-26**]:\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Bibasilar consolidation, left greater than right, and\nmoderate left\npleural effusion, may represent infection in the appropriate\nclinical setting.\n2. Moderate cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion. Mild\npulmonary edema.\n\nLE Ultrasound [**2125-11-26**]:\nIMPRESSION:\nNo left or right lower extremity DVT.\n\nRUQ Ultrasound [**2125-11-27**]:\nThe liver is echogenic and shows some irregularity of outline\nmore suggestive of cirrhosis than fatty liver, though either\ncould be the cause. Portal blood flow is towards the liver. No\nfocal defects are seen within the liver. The gallbladder is free\nof stones. The liver itself is enlarged.   Both right and left\nkidneys are normal. Spleen could not be identified suggesting\nthat it is not enlarged. Pancreas and aorta are hidden by\noverlying bowel gas. There is no ascites.\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal liver more consistent with cirrhosis than\nfatty infiltrate. No ascites.\n\nDischarge Labs:\n[**2125-12-6**] 07:00AM BLOOD WBC-9.2 RBC-4.38* Hgb-14.0 Hct-43.6\nMCV-100* MCH-32.0 MCHC-32.1 RDW-14.7 Plt Ct-194\n[**2125-12-6**] 07:00AM BLOOD Glucose-104* UreaN-13 Creat-0.9 Na-141\nK-3.4 Cl-94* HCO3-38* AnGap-12\n[**2125-12-5**] 06:45AM BLOOD Calcium-9.6 Phos-4.0 Mg-1.8\n\nStudies pending at Discharge:\nNone\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname 103584**] is a 60 y/o male with a history of hypertension,\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease, probable alcoholic\ncirrhosis, and alcohol abuse/dependence admitted with pneumonia\nand hypoxemic respiratory failure. Hospital course was notable\nfor alcohol withdrawal, encephalopathy, and acute diastolic\nheart failure.\n\n#Hypoxemic respiratory failure/Pneumonia/Severe exacerbation of\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease:\nChest X-ray was consistent with left lower lobe pneumonia and\npatient was requiried ICU admission and intubation. He was also\ngiven steroids for exacerbation of COPD and was able to be\nextubated. He completed his antibiotic course of Ceftriaxone and\nazithromycin during his hospitalization and was discharged off\nsupplemental oxygen. He was also started on maintenance\nTiotropium and inhaled fluticasone on discharge.\n\n#Acute diastolic heart failure:\nPatient was felt to be volume overloaded on admission and was\ndiuresed with improvement in pulmonary edema and oxygen\nrequirement. Since he has had poor PCP follow up in the past and\nwas felt to have heart failure exacerbation due to infection,\nwhich was treated prior to discharge, he was not discharged on\ndiuretics. Echocardiogram showed mild symmetric LVH, preserved\nLVEF, and mild RV dilation.\n\n#Alcohol withdrawal/encephalopathy/Cirrhosis:\nPatient became delirious and agitated following extubation and\nthis was felt to be due to alcohol withdrawal and benzodiazepine\nwithdrawal. He was treated with Haldol and tapering doses of\nbenzodiazepines and his mental status returned to [**Location 213**] prior\nto discharge. Although he had imaging consistent with cirrhosis,\nhe was not felt to have hepatic encephalopathy. Abdominal\nultrasound showed probable cirrhosis but no ascites. He was\ncounseled on importance of abstaining from alcohol and was given\nfolate and thiamine. He was maintained on CIWA protocol while on\nthe medical floor.\n\n# Transitional issues:\nPatient was discharged with PCP follow up of COPD, probable\ncirrhosis, diastolic heart failure, and alcohol abuse.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nSymbicort 80/4.5 prescribed but not using\nVitamin D (Dose unknown)\nVitamin B12 (Dose unknown)\nFolate (Dose unknown)\nCalcium (Dose unknown)\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. tiotropium bromide 18 mcg Capsule, w/Inhalation Device Sig:\nOne (1) Cap Inhalation DAILY (Daily).\nDisp:*1 Cap(s)* Refills:*2*\n2. folic acid 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\nTablet(s)\n3. thiamine HCl 100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n4. fluticasone 110 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Two (2) Puff\nInhalation [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day).\nDisp:*1 * Refills:*2*\n5. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig:\n1-2 puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of\nbreath or wheezing: please have pharmacist teach  you how to use\nthis.\nDisp:*1 * Refills:*0*\n6.

You were admitted to\nthe intensive care unit and a breathing tube was placed. You\nwere treated with antibiotics and your symptoms improved. You\nwere transferred to the medicine floor and continued to improve.\n\nDuring your hospital stay, you underwent an ultrasound of your\nliver which shows liver disease. It is very important that you\nstop drinking alcohol, as this can further damage your liver and\nmake you very sick. It is also important that you quit smoking,\nas this can increase your risk for developing pneumonia. You\nprimary care doctor can help you with this.\n\nIt is very important you follow up with your primary care doctor\nregarding your multiple medical conditions. Please go to your\nscheduled appointments. You need to have your primary care\ndoctor set up home physical therapy services.\n\nPlease check your weights each morning and if you notice greater\nthan 3 pound weight gain, please call your primary care doctor\nimmediately, as this can represent worsening heart failure.\n\nThe following changes were made to your medications:\n- Please START tiotropium inhaler daily -- this is to help with\nyour lungs because you have emphysema\n- Please STOP Symbicort\n- Please START fluticasone inhaler -- this is also for your\nlungs\n- Please START thiamine vitamins\n\nPlease be sure to schedule a followup appointment with your\nprimary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 807**].\n\nDr. [**First Name (STitle) 807**] may set you up with a liver specialist, a lung\nspecialist, and a heart specialist.\n\n1.) You likely have Emphysema from smoking so much, so you will\nneed to start the inhalers, as listed below.  You will also need\nto have pulmonary function tests when you are feeling back to\nnormal.\nPlease try to cut back as much as possible on your smoking to\nmake it easier to quit.\n\n2.) You were also found to have diastolic heart failure, which\nmeans that you can build up fluid easily in your lungs and legs\nif you eat extra salt.  Please try to avoid salt as much as\npossible in your diet.  Please also weigh yourself every morning\nbefore breakfast, as we discussed.  If you are gaining more than\n3 lbs, it is likely fluid weight, so you should call Dr. [**Name (NI) 30283**] office, and he may need to start you on a medication\ncalled furosemide so that you can urinate out the extra fluid.\n\n3.) You were also found to have cirrhosis of the liver, likely\nbecause of the alcohol you have been drinking over the years.\nPlease try to stop drinking alcohol, as this can cause further\nharm to your liver.  You will need to follow with a liver\nspecialist.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nName: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] A.\nLocation: [**Hospital **] MEDICAL PHYSICIANS, P.C.\nAddress: [**University/College 808**], [**Location (un) **],[**Numeric Identifier 809**]\nPhone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 823**]\n**Please contact your Primary Care Physician for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] follow up\nappointment from your hospital stay. It is recommended you\nfollow up with Dr [**First Name (STitle) 807**] within 1 week for a FULL PHYSICAL.**\n**Also please speak with your PCP about the need to follow up\nwith a Liver specialist, Heart specialist, Lung specialist**\n\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2125-12-9**]"
