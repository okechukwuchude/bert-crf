Evaluate for open skull\n fracture.\n\n COMPARISON:  None available.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.  Multiplanar reformations were generated.\n\n FINDINGS:  There is a left frontal epidural hematoma measuring 1.6 x 4.8 cm.\n There is also associated small amount of left subdural/epidural blood, which\n measures 2.4 mm (2:19).  There are no intraparenchymal foci of hemorrhage.\n There is moderate gyral effacement due to the epidural hematoma.  There is no\n significant shift of midline structures.  The ventricles and sulci are normal\n in size and configuration.  The [**Known lastname 107**] and white matter differentiation is well\n preserved.  There is no evidence of downward transtentorial or subfalcine\n herniation.  Small amount of pneumocephalus is noted in the left frontal\n region.\n\n IMPRESSION:  There is a left frontal epidural hematoma and a small associated\n subdural/epidural hematoma as described above.  The above findings were\n communicated verbally to the neurosurgical resident on-call, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3922**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1368**]\n at 5:55 a.m. on [**2134-3-22**].\n\n Final Attending Comment:\n There is a fracture  of the left frontal bone and on image 36, a tiny bony\n fragment appears to have been displaced into the brain.\n\n"

She was\neventually extubated without any difficulty.\n\nNeurosurgery was consulted for the epidural/subdural frontal\nhemorrhage. She was placed on Dilantin which will continue for a\n7 day course as prophylaxis for seizures. Repeat head CT scans\nremained stable.

Hand swelling.  Assess for fracture or foreign\n body.\n\n RIGHT HAND:\n\n There is no evidence of acute fracture.  No radiopaque foreign body is seen.\n\n LEFT HAND:\n\n There is a small fragment displaced from the dorsal aspect of the base of one\n of the left metacarpals.  It is seen only on the lateral view where the second\n through fourth _____ overlap each other.  It most likely arises from the\n dorsal aspect of the base of the third metacarpal.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n No evidence of radiopaque foreign body.  Small fracture fragment arising from\n the dorsal aspect of the base of one of the left metacarpals, most likely the\n third, although it is difficult to be certain since these metacarpals overlap\n on the lateral view which is the only view where the fracture is seen.\n\n Report phoned to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6311**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7673**] at 2:30 p.m. on 6 _____ [**2133**].\n\n\n"
