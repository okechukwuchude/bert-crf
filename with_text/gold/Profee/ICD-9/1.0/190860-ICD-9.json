She was\nhypotensive to the 70s in triage and received IV fluids.  She\nwas noted to have creatinine 8, TBili 10, and Lipase 3400.  RUQ\nultrasound showed biliary sludge with no visible stone.  CT\nabdomen showed colitis.  She was treated with Levofloxacin 500\nmg IV and Metronidazole 500 mg IV, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for\nERCP due to concern for biliary obstruction, cholangitis, and\ngallstone pancreatitis.\n.\nIn the ED, initial vital signs were T 97.1, BP 103/60, HR 100,\nRR 20, SpO2 98% on RA.  She arrived on her seventh liter of NS,\nbut was still hypotensive in the 90s systolic.  Central access\nwas obtained with a right IJ line.  She also has access with two\n18g PIVs.  Foley catheter was placed for urine output\nmonitoring.  She was mentating well and in no acute distress.\nInitial labs showed multiple electrolyte abnormalities including\nNa 126, Ca 6.7, and bicarb 12 with anion gap 16 and lactate 2.3.\n Her creatinine had decreased to 4.6 from 8 at OSH after IV\nfluids.  Her LFTs were still abnormal but generally improved\nfrom OSH labs.  She had a leukocytosis with WBC 13.9 and anemia\nwith Hct 23.6.  Her INR was elevated to 1.6.  Her stool was\nguaiac negative.  ERCP and Surgery were consulted in the ED, and\nshe is planned for ERCP this morning.  She was admitted to the\nICU for further monitoring and management.  Vitals prior to\ntransfer were BP 114/57, HR 102, and CVP 8.\n.\nOnce in the ICU, she denied any pain or other specific\ncomplaints besides the Foley catheter being uncomfortable.  She\nwas in no acute distress and mentating well.  She denied any\ncurrent nausea or abdominal pain.\n.\nReview of systems:\n(+) Per HPI. She noted some chills at home prior to admission\nbut no fevers.  She reports losing about 25 lbs over the last\nfew weeks due to lack of appetite.  She has an occasional cough\nwhich has not changed recently.\n(-) Denies fever, night sweats. Denies headache, sinus\ntenderness, rhinorrhea, or congestion. Denies shortness of\nbreath or wheezing.

There is no pleural effusion or\npneumothorax.\n.\n[**6-20**] CXR\nIMPRESSION No evidence of pneumonia.\n.\n[**6-25**] CXR\nFINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-20**], there is no\ninterval change or\nevidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease. Specifically, no\npneumonia,\nvascular congestion, or pleural effusion.\n.\n[**6-17**] ERCP\nImpression: Successful biliary cannulation was achieved.\nPartial opacification of the biliary tree was performed because\nof clinical suspicion of cholangitis- no evidence of stones or\nfilling defects was seen.\nSuccessful placement of a 7cm x 10Fr stent for biliary drainage-\nwith drainage of clear bile.\nOtherwise normal ERCP to 3rd portion of duodenum.\nRecommendations: Juices when awake and alert, then advance diet\nas tolerated.\nContinue antibiotics.\nNo definitive explanation for jaundice found on ERCP, although\ncontrast opacification limited. It is possible that the patient\npassed a stone. Consider evaluation for other causes of jaundice\nincluding viral hepatitis.  Follow-up ERCP will allow for\ncomplete evaluation of intrahepatics given possibility of PSC.\nRepeat ERCP in 4 weeks for stent removal and complete evaluation\nof biliary tree.\n.\n[**6-18**] RUQ US\nFINDINGS: The liver is diffusely increased in echogenicity,\nconsistent with\nfatty infiltration of the liver. No focal hepatic mass is\ndefinitely noted.\nThere is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic ductal dilatation with\nthe common\nbile duct measuring 4mm. However, the known common bile duct\nstent is not\nvisualized. The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal\nflow.\n\nThe gallbladder is mildly distended, without wall thickening,\npericholecystic\nfluid, or son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign. Sludge is visualized within\nthe\ngallbladder. Additionally, there are echogenic foci with dirty\nposterior\nshadowing in nondependent portions of the gallbladder is\nconsistent with air\nwithin the gallbladder lumen, likely from recent ERCP and\nsphincterotomy.\n\nThe spleen is mildly enlarged measuring 13 cm. There is no\nascites.\nBilateral kidneys are without evidence of hydronephrosis. The\npancreas is not\nwell visualized due to overlying bowel gas.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Gallbladder sludge without acute cholecystitis. There is also\nevidence of\nair within the gallbladder lumen, likely from recent ERCP and\nsphincterotomy.\n2. Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration of the\nliver. More\nsignificant liver disease including significant hepatic\nfibrosis/cirrhosis\ncannot be excluded based on this study.\n3. No biliary dilatation, although the common bile duct stent is\nnot\nvisualized.\n.\n[**6-21**] MRCP\nMR ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is marked diffuse fatty\ndeposition of the\nliver in addition to more focal areas of almost mass-like fatty\ndeposition\nsurrounding the gallbladder fossa (3A:9, 12). There is also\ndeposits of\nincreased fat within the periphery of the liver. There is a\nheterogeneous\nenhancement pattern to the liver suggesting diffuse liver\ndisease beyond fatty\ndeposition. This appearance could be seen with chronic fibrosis,\nalthough\nthere are no other findings on this study to suggest cirrhosis.\nThe hepatic\nand portal veins are patent. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic\nbiliary\ndilation.\n\nA stent is noted in place within the common bile duct. While\nthere is mild\nenhancement of the bile duct wall at the level of the stent,\nabove the level\nof the stent, the bile ducts do not demonstrate any abnormal\nenhancement to\nsuggest cholangitis.\n\nThere is diffuse gallbladder wall edema which is likely related\nto the\nunderlying liver process. There is no hyperenhancement of the\ngallbladder\nwall or surrounding liver to suggest acute cholecystitis. The\ngallbladder\ncontains sludge.\n\nNo pancreatic mass is identified. The pancreas demonstrates\nnormal\nhomogeneous enhancement throughout. The pancreatic duct appears\nnormal. There\nis small amount of peripancreatic fluid/edema consistent with\npatient's\ndiagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The splenic vein and superior\nmesenteric\nveins remain patent. There are no fluid collections.\n\nThere is a trace amount of perihepatic and perisplenic ascites.\nThe spleen,\nadrenal glands, kidneys, and stomach are within normal limits.\nThere is no\nretroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No evidence of pancreatic mass. Small amount of\nperipancreatic fluid/edema\nis consistent with uncomplicated acute pancreatitis. Trace\nperihepatic and\nperisplenic ascites.\n\n2. Marked diffuse fatty deposition in the liver. However,\nheterogeneous\nenhancement of the liver suggests diffuse liver disease beyond\nfatty liver,\npossibly reflecting hepatitis oor fibrosis, though there is not\novert\ncirrhosis.\n\n3. Gallbladder wall edema, likely due to underlying liver\ndisease.\nGallbladder sludge.\n\n4. Biliary stent in place without intra or extraphepatic biliary\ndilation.\nMild enhancement of the common bile duct is likely from stent\nplacement.\nThere is no evidence of abnormal biliary ductal enhancement\nabove the level of\nthe stent to suggest cholangitis.\n\n.\n[**6-28**] ECHO\nFindings\nLEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.\n\nRIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.\n\nLEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and\nregional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%). Estimated cardiac\nindex is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). TDI E/e' < 8, suggesting normal\nPCWP (<12mmHg). No resting LVOT gradient.\n\nRIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.\n\nAORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch\nlevels.\n\nAORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.\nNo AR.\n\nMITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.\nMild thickening of mitral valve chordae. No MR.\n\nTRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Physiologic\nTR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.\n\nPULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.\nNo PS. Physiologic PR.\n\nPERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.\n\nGENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.\n\nConclusions\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are\nnormal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal\n(>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left\nventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of\naorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic\nstenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The\nmitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral\nvalve prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild\nto moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic\nfunction. Mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n46 year old female with a medical history of hypertension &\ndepression transferred from [**Hospital6 2561**] after\npresenting with 4 days of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and\nworsening jaundice. Admitted to the ICU, found to have acute\nalcoholic pancreatitis and hepatitis.\n.\n# Acute Alcoholic Pancreatitis:\nPt presented to OSH with symptoms consistent with acute\npancreatitis. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, but\ninitial denied alcohol use within the past 2 years, so gallstone\npancreatitis was suspected. RUQ ultrasound at OSH reportedly\nshowed sludge without visible stone. She underwent ERCP with CBD\nstent placement. Lipase was initially quite elevated and trended\ndown moderately after aggressive IVF. Other possible causes for\nher pancreatitis were explored, including the possibility of\nabdominal trauma suffered in a single-car accident the patient\nsuffered two weeks before this admission. However, MRCP was\nnegative. When TTG was elevated and patient was confronted with\nthe lack of other explanations for her acute\npancreatitis/hepatitis, she admitted to drinking 1.5 bottles of\nwine/day prior to admission (see below, alcohol abuse).\n.\n# Acute Alcoholic Hepatitis:\nPt also presented with elevated LFTs and jaundice. Alcoholic\nhepatitis was diagnosed when biliary obstruction and viral\nhepatitis were ruled out. She had initially been started on\nantibiotics in the ED, but these were stopped given lack of\nconcern for infection. Patient provided additional history of\nrecent MVA with 6 g/day tylenol use for 3 days thereafter\n([**Date range (1) 24996**]) + intermittent alcohol use. Hepatology was consulted\nin the ICU with concern for PSC or other liver parenchymal\nprocess, in addition to alcohol and possible tylenol overdose;\nthe patient was transferred to the hepatology service after\ndischarge from the ICU. Her leukocytosis persisted, LFTs\nremained elevated and she continued to spike fevers. These were\nthought to be [**12-21**] underlying alcoholic hepatitis rather than\ninfection, especially since only 1 bottle of many many blood\nculture samples was ever positive for bacterial growth, and thus\nwas thought to be a lab contaminant. She received a 7-day course\nof vancomycin, then was started on pentoxyfilline.\n.\n# Coagulopathy:\nRelated to hepatitis. The patient??????s INR was elevated to 1.6 on\narrival at the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. She does not have a reported history of\nliver disease and is not on anticoagulation at home. Best\nexplained by new diagnosis of acute alcoholic hepatitis.\n.\n# Hypotension:\nRelated to pancreatitis. Patient was hypotensive on admission\nwith SBP 90s despite receiving significant IV fluids at OSH.\nHer hypotension was likely related to fluid shifts from acute\nalcoholic pancreatitis rather than sepsis. SBP improved to the\n110s with IV fluids. She was restarted on a decreased dose of\nhome metoprolol (25 mg QD) but home lisinopril was held given\nacute renal injury (below). Lisinopril was restarted at\ndischarge.\n.\n# Hyponatremia:\nRelated to pancreatitis/hepatitis. Resolved with current Na 137\nin the ICU, up from 126 on admission and 123 at OSH.  This\nlikely represented hypovolemic hyponatremia from her\npancreatitis and volume depletion from GI losses and poor PO\nintake.\n.\n# [**Last Name (un) **]:\nCreatinine 8.0 on admission to OSH, fell gradually during this\nadmission, to 1.2 at discharge. Baseline creatinine was unknown.\nThe most likely etiology was prerenal from hypotension and fluid\nshifts in the context of pancreatitis. Maintained urine output\nin the context of aggressive IVF hydration as above.\n.\n# Metabolic Acidosis:\nPatient had an anion gap acidosis at the OSH. Lactate was 1.2 at\nOSH and 2.3 here.  Acidosis thought to be related to\npancreatitis, [**Last Name (un) **], and ketones from alcohol intake/poor\nnutrition prior to admission. Resolved by time of discharge,\nwith bicarb 24 and anion gap 10.\n.\n# Anemia:\nHct was 28.2 at OSH. Baseline Hct unknown.  She reports recent\ndiarrhea that was sometimes black, but her stool was guaiac\nnegative in the ED.  She has not had a menstrual period since\n[**Month (only) 404**].  Her RBCs are macrocytic with MCV 104. Iron panel was\ndifficult to interpret in the setting of her current acute\nillness. Hct was trended, iron panel, B12, and folate were\nchecked. She received B12, folate, and iron supplementation\nduring this admission.\n.\n# Leukocytosis:\nPatient presented with a leukocytosis, WBC 13.9; this rose\nduring admission. Attributed to alcoholic hepatitis. Cultures\nall negative apart from a single spuriously-positive GPC blood\nculture. WBC remained >15 after treatment with vancomycin.\n.\n# Depression:\nReports 25-lb weight loss in past 3 weeks secondary to stress.\nShe is on Lexapro for depression and . These should be held for\nnow pending improvement in her renal and hepatic function, both\nof which are currently impaired. Recent alcohol use likely\ncontributed to her current presentation, and should be\nreaddressed prior to and after discharge as she will continue to\nneed support for this ongoing issue.\n.\n# Alcohol Abuse:\nPatient has longstanding history of alcohol abuse; she sees a\ntherapist [**Hospital1 **]-weekly and a psychopharmacologist for Campral\nprescription. Denies alcohol use within the past 2 years until\nconfronted with laboratory data (GGT) confirming her providers'\nsuspicion of ongoing alcohol use. Family meeting was held prior\nto discharge, to discuss prognosis for alcoholic hepatitis,\nrequest that husband remove all alcohol from the home, agree\nupon a plan for post-discharge detox program, and to re-inforce\nthe absolute importance of abstinence for her survival.\nInpatient social work has arranged for outpatient detox, to\nbegin the Monday after discharge ([**7-3**]); patient was unwilling\nto be discharged directly to a detox facility. Outpatient\ntherapist aware and will follow-up; psychopharmacologist alerted\nby telephone.\n.\n# Recent motor vehicle accident:\nLarge bruise noted on pt's lower back during physical\nexamination in the ICU. Pt reported history of a single-vehicle\ncar accident on [**6-5**]: she drove over two curbs in trying to\navoid other drivers, resulting in two blown tires. She denies\nsteering wheel impact and did not seek police or medical\nattention after the accident. Denied alcohol use prior to this\naccident. Took 6 g/day tylenol in the 3 days following, which\nmay have contributed to her liver failure.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n1. ***Alcohol abuse follow-up.*** Patient has agreed to\ninpatient detox but wanted to go home first to see her\n8-year-old son. Inpatient social worker [**Name (NI) 636**] [**Name (NI) 12471**] and\noutpatient therapist will follow-up to ensure this happens.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nLexapro 30 mg PO daily\nLisinopril 10 mg PO daily\nMetoprolol 50 mg PO BID\nCampral (Acamprosate) 333 mg 2 tabs TID\nOmeprazole OTC PO daily\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. multivitamin     Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n\n2. thiamine HCl 100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\nDisp:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n3. folic acid 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\nDisp:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n4. omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)

No gallstones or obstruction\nwas seen. A stent was placed in the bile duct, to allow free\ndrainage of bile into your intestines, in case there was some\nmild obstruction not seen on the test.\n.\nYour liver and pancreas enzyme levels were followed during this\nadmission. These were very elevated when you first arrived, but\nthey trended down with IV fluids and time. However, they were\nstill elevated at the time of discharge and you were still\njaundiced. You were not having any abdominal pain. We looked for\ninfection but did not see any signs. The inflammation in your\npancreas and liver appeared to be from another non-infectious\ncause.\n.\nWe thought your liver and pancreas inflammation was due to\nalcohol consumption. Lab tests showed that this was true. You do\nhave several reasons for increased stress in your life recently.\nYou met with a social worker during this hospitalization who\nwill help coordinate your care after you leave the hospital. We\nfelt it was very important that you get adequate support after\nyou leave the hospital so that you can stay sober. Drinking\nalcohol will further injury your pancreas and liver, which are\nalready fragile. You will see your own therapist, [**Female First Name (un) **], twice a\nweek from now on. She will help you follow-through with your\nintention to enroll in a full-time alcohol detox program within\na week after leaving the hospital.\n.\nWhen you first arrived, we treated you with intravenous\nantibiotics to fight a possible bacterial infection in your\ngallbladder. Later we gave you antibiotics again when we\nsuspected an infection in your blood. Laboratory tests showed\nthat you were not infected at the time you left the hospital.\n.\nWe made the following changes to your medications:\n1. We DECREASED your metoprolol dose to 25 mg per day.\n2. We STARTED you on Pentoxifylline 400 mg PO three times daily\n3. We STARTED you on multivitamins and thiamine which you should\ntake daily\n.\nPlease continue to take all other medications as prescribed, or\nas instructed by your doctor.\n.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nWe arranged a follow-up appointment with your primary care\ndoctor:\n\nName: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2671**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]\nLocation: [**Hospital **] MEDICAL ASSOCIATION\nAddress: [**Apartment Address(1) 83440**], [**Hospital1 **],[**Numeric Identifier 4293**]\nPhone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 26774**]\nAppointment: Friday [**6-30**] 2:15 PM\n.\nPlease call Dr.[**Name (NI) 90544**] office if you need to reschedule this\nappointment.\n\nPlease also call your Psychopharmacologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 90545**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 90546**] to book a follow up appointment within\n1 week.\n.\nYou should also see your therapist next week. The [**Hospital1 18**] social\nworker will be in contact with your therapist to ensure a smooth\ntransition so you can receive the support you need.\n.\nYou will also need to follow-up with the ERCP service, to have\nthe stent removed. Dr[**Name (NI) 90547**] administrator, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 803**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15954**],\nwill call you to arrange this appointment. If you don't hear\nfrom her by next Monday, please call her at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 21143**].\n\n\n\n"

No focal hepatic mass is definitely noted.\n There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic ductal dilatation with the common\n bile duct measuring 4mm.  However, the known common bile duct stent is not\n visualized.  The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow.\n\n The gallbladder is mildly distended, without wall thickening, pericholecystic\n fluid, or son[**Name (NI) 211**] [**Name2 (NI) 212**] sign. Sludge is visualized within the\n gallbladder.  Additionally, there are echogenic foci with dirty posterior\n shadowing in nondependent portions of the gallbladder is consistent with air\n within the gallbladder lumen, likely from recent ERCP and sphincterotomy.\n\n The spleen is mildly enlarged measuring 13 cm.  There is no ascites.\n Bilateral kidneys are without evidence of hydronephrosis.  The pancreas is not\n well visualized due to overlying bowel gas.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n 1.  Gallbladder sludge without acute cholecystitis.  There is also evidence of\n air within the gallbladder lumen, likely from recent ERCP and sphincterotomy.\n 2.  Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration of the liver.  More\n significant liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis\n cannot be excluded based on this study.\n 3.  No biliary dilatation, although the common bile duct stent is not\n visualized.\n\n"

There is also deposits of\n increased fat within the periphery of the liver.  There is a heterogeneous\n enhancement pattern to the liver suggesting diffuse liver disease beyond fatty\n deposition.
