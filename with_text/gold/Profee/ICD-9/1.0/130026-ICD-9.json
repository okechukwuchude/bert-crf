Progression of left perihilar and lower hemithorax opacities may represent\n  aspiration or consolidation.\n  2.

Baseline evaluation and\n evaluation of line placement.  Question of aortic dissection.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest.\n\n COMPARISON:  Radiographs dated [**2103-9-18**], obtained approximately nine\n hours prior at [**Hospital **] Hospital.\n\n FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position approximately 3.4 cm\n above the carina.  An esophageal catheter is in place with tip just beyond the\n gastroesophageal junction and side port within the distal esophagus.  This\n would need to be advanced 7 cm to ensure the most proximal side port is within\n the stomach.  Opacities in the left middle and lower hemithorax, possible\n aspiration or consildation appear slightly progressed.  No pneumothorax or\n pleural effusion is seen.  There is tortuosity of the aorta.  The heart size\n is top normal.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n 1.  Progression of left perihilar and lower hemithorax opacities may represent\n aspiration or consolidation.\n 2.  Esophageal catheter with side port in the distal esophagus and would need\n to be advanced 7 cm to ensure most proximal side port within the stomach.\n\n"

Normal interatrial septum.\nNo ASD by 2D or color Doppler. Normal IVC diameter (>2.1cm) with <50% decrease\nwith sniff (estimated RA pressure (>=15 mmHg).\n\nLEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. Mild global LV\nhypokinesis. No LV mass/thrombus. TDI E/e' >15, suggesting PCWP>18mmHg. No\nresting LVOT gradient. No VSD.\n\nRIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion. Paradoxic septal\nmotion consistent with conduction abnormality/ventricular pacing.\n\nAORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels.\n\nAORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.\n\nMITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. No MS. Mild (1+)\nMR.\n\nTRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. No TS. Mild [1+]\nTR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.\n\nPULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS.\n\nPERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.\n\nGENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows. Suboptimal\nimage quality as the patient was difficult to position. Suboptimal image\nquality - body habitus. Suboptimal image quality - ventilator. Suboptimal\nimage quality - patient unable to cooperate. Resting bradycardia (HR<60bpm).\n\nConclusions:\nThe left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color\nDoppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is\nmoderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity\nsize is normal. There is probably mild global left ventricular hypokinesis\n(LVEF = 50 %) (the degree of bradycardia and conduction delay associated LV\ndysynchrony make an accurate estimate of LVEF more difficult). No masses or\nthrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an\nincreased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no\nventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion\nare normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis\nis not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are\nmildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral\nregurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.\nThere is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial\neffusion.\n\n\n"

No\n contrast was administered.\n\n FINDINGS:  Compared to the most recent study on [**2103-9-19**], there is\n decrease in pneumocephalus with no residual air on the left and decrease in\n amount of air on the right.  There is residual subdural collection on the\n left, unchanged from study on [**2103-9-19**].  There is residual subdural\n collection on the right, unchanged from study on [**2103-9-19**]. Within the\n right subdural collection, there is hyperdense material layering over the\n right frontovertex convexity likely representing normal postoperative blood,\n decreased in size from yesterday.  The hyperdensity at the parietovertex\n convexity is not well seen today compared to yesterday's study.  Bilateral\n burr holes are again seen.  The drain on the right has been removed.  The size\n and configuration of the ventricles is normal and unchanged.  The [**Doctor Last Name 34**]-white\n differentiation is preserved.  There is a slight decrease in opacification of\n the ethmoid air cells and sphenoid sinus.  There is a mucus-retention cyst in\n the left maxillary sinus.  Nasogastric tube has been removed.  The patient is\n status post bilateral ocular lens surgery.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n 1.  Decrease in pneumocephalus, resolved on the left and decreased in amount\n on the right.\n\n 2.  Some residual blood products along the convexities bilaterally, unchanged\n in size compared to yesterday.\n\n 3.

No atrial septal defect is seen by\n2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is at\nleast 15 mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular\nhypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There\nis probably mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50\n%) (the degree of bradycardia and conduction delay associated LV\ndysynchrony make an accurate estimate of LVEF more difficult).\nNo masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue\nDoppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling\npressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.\nRight ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.\nThe diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels\nare normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened\nbut aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is\nseen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is\nno mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is\nseen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There\nis mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nCXR [**2103-9-18**]\n1. Progression of left perihilar and lower hemithorax opacities\nmay represent aspiration or consolidation.\n2. Esophageal catheter with side port in the distal esophagus\nand would need to be advanced 7 cm to ensure most proximal side\nport within the stomach.\n\nCT head [**2103-9-19**]\n1. Marked reduction in size of a right subdural hematoma, with a\ndrain in\nplace, and some residual blood products, layering dependently.\n2. Bifrontal pneumocephalus, increased on the left, following\nremoval of this drain.\n3. No new focus of hemorrhage.\n4. Partial sinus opacification, particular of the sphenoid air\ncells, which may relate to intubation and supine positioning.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname 46825**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] TSICU. On arrival,\nintubated, he was sedated with bradycardia to the 30s requiring\nx1 atropine with good response. A right axillary arterial line\nplaced. Neurosurgery evaluated the patient and removed the L JP\ndrain. The right drain was less functional and was milked with\nimproved output.\n\nA chest X-rays showed progression of left perihilar and lower\nhemithorax opacities may represent aspiration or consolidation.\nAn ECHO was done showed\nEF 50% (the degree of bradycardia and conduction delay\nassociated LV dysynchrony make an accurate estimate of LVEF more\ndifficult).\n\nHe was on a nitro drip at 1mcg/kg/min with SBP goal < 140. EPS\nwas consulted.\nThey agreed with the plan for Hydralazine PRN for BP control\nand approved restarting home dose of lisinopril and amlodipine\nwhen tolerating po's.  He was extubated overnight.\n\nVascular surgery consulted and they felt that this abdominal\npain at OSH was likely not due to his 18mm dissection. There are\nno plan for intervention at this point.\nHe was trasnfered to the Neurosurgery service under the care of\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**]. He was getting Dilantin 100mg TID with 1000mg\ninitial load.  CT head on [**9-19**] showed improvement in right SDH\nbut the drain was left in place for further evacuation in the am\nand this was removed in the pm. Orders for trasnfer to SDU were\nwritten.\n\nCT head in the am of [**2103-9-20**] showed...He had expiratory whezzing\nand nebulizer treatment was started. SQH was started for DVT\nprophylaxis. Foley cathter was discontinued. PT was consulted.\nThey recommended rehab.
