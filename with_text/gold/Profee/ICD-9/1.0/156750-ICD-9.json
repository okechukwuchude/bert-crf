Facial nerve monitoring.\n2. Laryngeal nerve monitoring.\n3. Transcervical resection of left glomus vagale tumor.\n4. Transcervical resection of left carotid body tumor.\n5. Left Mastoidectomy with sigmoid decompression\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\nThe patient is a 38 yo female with bilateral carotid body tumors\nand a\nlarge left skull base paraganglioma/left vagus glomus tumor.  3D\nCT angiogram [**2133-8-31**] demonstrated a glomus vagale 4.1x 2.2x\n1.8cm\nthat extends from below the region of the carotid bifurcation\nand\nup to the skull base.  It does not enter the jugular foramen.\nShe also has a small carotid body tumor on the contralateral\nside\nthat is 1.7x 1.3x 2.1cm.  An octreotide scan had tracer uptake\nin\nthe area of the left glomus vagale.  However, the carotid body\ntumor had no uptake.  The SPECT/CT images also demonstrate a\n5-mm\nnodule in the left anterior lung without evidence of tracer\nuptake.  The patient carries the SDHD gene.  She has been tested\nand found to have normal plasma normetanephrine, an undetectable\ncalcitonin, and a normal ionized calcium.  She underwent\npreoperative embolization which was successful for an upper\nportion of the tumor, however, a\nseparate portion which was smaller and inferior could not be\nembolized  adequately.  In addition to this tumor, she has a\ncontralateral carotid body tumor.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nLeft vagal glomus tumor, as above\nBilateral carotid body tumors, as above\nHypertension.\nGastroesophageal reflux.\nHead injury [**2130**].\nquestion of history of [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4516**] disease.\n\nSocial History:\nShe is employed as an executive administrator and is married.\nShe currently smokes and has for 22 years.

She had undergone pre-operative\nembolization, which she tolerated without issue.  She was taken\nto the OR on [**2133-11-12**] for left mastiodectomy, sigmoid\ndecompression, transcervical resection of left glomus vagale\ntumor and resection of left carotid body tumor with facial and\nlaryngeal nerve monitoring. For details, please see separately\ndictated note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3878**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**]. The patient\ntolerated procedure without complications.  She was taken to the\nICU for first 24 hours for monitoring of neurological status,\nwhich remained stable, and was thereafter transfered to the\nfloor.  The details of her hospital course are reviewed below by\nststems:\n\nNeuro: Postoperatively, the patient was taken to the ICU for\ncloser monitoring of her vital signs and neurological function,\ngiven the proximity of the surgery to the carotid artery. Her\nexam remained stable and she was transfered to the floor on POD\n1. Regarding her cranial nerve exam, post-operatively, she was\nnoted to have some weakness with tongue movement to the left\n(left CN XII) as well as paralysis of the left true vocal cord,\ndeceased peristalysis of left pharyngeal wall with some pooling\nof secretions on that side which was anticipated given intra-op\nresection of the left vagus nerve. As a result of anticipated\ndifficulty with POs, an NGT was placed on POD #1; on POD #4,\nafter evaluation by speech and swallow, a diet was initiated\nwith compensatory maneuvers (see below) for her nerve deficits.\nPain was initially controlled with IV dilaudid while she was\nNPO. After NGT placement on POD1, she was transitioned to pain\nmedications through the NGT with good effect.\n\nCV: She had elevated BP to SBP 160-180 in the initial\npost-operative days which were attributed to pain and\nhemodynamic re-adjustment after carotid body removal.  Her blood\npressure normalized by POD #5.  She was instructed to follow-up\nwith PCP as an outpatient to have her blood pressure monitored.\n\nResp: The patient had oxygen saturations >95% throughout\nadmission.  She demonstrated good cough and was able to control\nher oral secretions.  She used suctioning as needed to help with\nany excess oropharyngeal secretions and arrangement were made\nfor suction machine at home.\n\nGI: In light of vagus nerve resection secondary to the tumor,\nshe was initially kept NPO pending further evaluation.  An NGT\nwas placed on POD #1 and she was started on continuous tube feed\ndiet with Replete with fiber @ 60 cc/hr.  Nutrition was\nconsulted who agreed with plan.  Speech/swallow was consulted on\nPOD #4 and she underwent a video floroscopic examination to\nevaluate pharyngeal swallowing mechanism and aspiration. She had\ndecrease mobility of the left side of her pharynx with some\npooling on the left side, but this was compensated for by head\nturn to left, chin tuck and hand pressure to left neck.  She was\ncleared for a pureed, moist thin food with thin liquid diet,\nwhich she tolerated.  She was instructed on signs/symptoms to\nlook for in terms of aspiration.  She was discharged with a plan\nto continue on cycled tube feeds nocturnally with replete with\nfiber @ 80 cc/hr x 14 hrs and and diet as above with oral\nnutrition supplements as tolerated. She is to follow-up with\nNutrition and Speech/Swallow as an outpatient.\n\nGU: The patient voided throughout admission without signs of\nretention or UTI.\n\nHeme: The patient ambulated frequently and was given SCH for DVT\nprophylaxis during admission.\n\nEndo: no issues\n\nID: The patient recieved perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis\nwith clindamycin until the drain was removed.  Her wound\nremained clean, intact and with erythema or signs of infection.\nShe was afebrile throughout her hospital stay.\n\nWound: The patient had a neck drain in place, which was removed\non POD#3 as it met output criteria.  Her neck incision is closed\nwith sutures which will be removed as an outpatient. Her wound\nremained clean, dry and intact.\n\nPatient is being discharged [**2133-11-17**], POD #5, to home with VNA\nservices: afebrile, tolerating regular tube feeding via NGT with\npureed, moist food with thin liquid oral diet, pain well\ncontrolled on oral/per tube medication, voiding, and ambulating\nwell.   Patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] and Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) 3878**] in 1 week, nutrition and speech and swallow in [**2-14**] weeks\nas well as her primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2-14**] weeks.\n\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nTylenol prn\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

On CT there is a mass present somewhat posterior to the carotid\n  bifurcation, not displacing the bifurcation as much but this appears to be\n  connected to a much larger mass that extends to the base of the skull and is\n  displacing the internal carotid artery anteriorly.\n REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:\n  Pre-surgical angiography with embolization of LEFT carotid body tumor.\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n HISTORY:  Paragangliomas.\n\n PROCEDURE:  Embolization of left cervical paragangliomas.\n\n ATTENDING:[**Name (STitle) 86205**]\n ASSISTANT: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2151**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], NP.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  After explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure to the\n patient, written informed consent was obtained from the patient.  Risks\n explained included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or permanent,\n with possible treatment with stent and coils if needed.\n\n The patient was brought to interventional neuroradiology suite and placed\n supine on the biplane table.  General anesthesia was provided by the\n anesthesiologist.  Preprocedure huddle and timeout was performed as per\n protocol.  Both groins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.\n\n Access to the right common femoral artery was obtained using a 19-gauge\n single-wall needle under local anesthesia using 1% lidocaine.  Through the\n needle, a 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 89**] wire was introduced and the needle taken out.  A 7\n French, 10-cm long Terumo sheath set was then placed and connected to a saline\n infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of saline) with a continuous\n drip.\n\n Various catheters were used during the procedure through this sheath including\n a 4 French Berenstein catheter and a 6 French Envoy guiding catheter.  A\n number of microcatheters were used as well including an Excelsior SL-10 150-cm\n microcatheter.

After review of the films, the catheter and\n sheath were withdrawn and the artery was sutured with an Angio-Seal closure\n device.  In addition, pressure was applied on the groin until hemostasis was\n obtained.  The procedure was uneventful and the patient tolerated the\n procedure well.  She was escorted to the intensive care unit.\n\n The following blood vessels were selectively catheterized and arteriograms\n were obtained in AP and lateral projections:\n 1.  Left common carotid artery.\n 2.  3D rotational angiography of the left common carotid artery.\n 3.  Left internal maxillary artery.\n 4.  Left ascending pharyngeal artery.\n 5.  Left lingual artery.\n\n FINDINGS:  Arteriograms of the above vessels demonstrated a large, intensely\n enhancing mass splaying the internal and external carotid arteries.  The mass\n had two main components, a larger superior and smaller inferior portion.  It\n was fed by branches from the carotid bifurcation and external carotid artery.\n Based on the diagnostic findings, the decision was made to perform\n embolization.\n\n The left internal maxillary artery was catheterized with a microcatheter via\n the left external carotid artery.  With careful attention to exclude any\n collateral flow to the intracranial circulation, third-order branches from the\n internal maxillary artery that fed the tumor were embolized with 100-300 PVA\n and coiled.\n\n Subsequently, the left ascending pharyngeal artery was catheterized with a\n microcatheter.  This arose from the internal carotid artery.  Again with\n careful attention to exclude any collateral flow to the intracranial\n circulation, third-order branches of the ascending pharyngeal artery that fed\n the tumor were embolized with 300-500 PVA and coiled.\n\n Finally, the lingual artery was catheterized with a microcatheter via the left\n external carotid artery.  Again with attention to excluding collateral flow to\n the intracranial circulation, third order branches of the lingual artery that\n fed the mass were embolized with 300-500 PVA and coiled.\n\n Subsequent arteriogram revealed successful embolization to the larger,\n superior portion of the paraganglioma.  However, the inferior portion was only\n partially embolized via the lingual and ascending pharyngeal branches.  We\n were unable to localize more direct flow to this portion of the tumor.\n\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2133-11-11**] 12:50 PM\n CAROT/CEREB [**Hospital1 78**]                                                  Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 86204**]\n Reason: Pre-surgical angiography with embolization of LEFT carotid b\n  Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 437\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n Post-procedure arteriogram demonstrated good flow within the internal carotid\n artery and distal branches.\n\n The intracranial circulation revealed no flow-limiting stenosis and no\n aneurysm.
