Very difficult to sterilize given post obstructive nature.\n   Getting XRT to region; too ill for chemo at present time.

I agree with his\n   note above, including assessment and plan.  PMH, SH, FH and ROS are\n   unchanged from admission except where noted above.\n   77 y/o with metastatic NSCLC (spine involvement with cord compression)\n   admitted for resp distress.  Has RUL mass with necrosis impinging on\n   bronchi, post-obs pna, effusion.  [**11-17**] pleurX placed. [**11-18**] discharged\n   to rehab. PleurX not accessible (apparently pt was missing the\n   equipment needed for draining), reaccumulated fluid and developed resp\n   distress with tachycardia, tachypnea. Drained 550cc fluid, pt felt much\n   improved (back to baseline). Supplemental O2 weaned from NRB to 2L NC\n   overnight.\n   PMH reviewed: CDiff colitis [**10-8**], COPD.\n   Currently afebrile 117/60 100-110 since metoprolol (12.5 tid) given PO,\n   prior had episodes of MAT 160s. Sat high 90s% on NC.\n   Denies dyspnea, pain. Tells us his breathing is comfortable. However,\n   ROS limited by language barrier (translator not available for rounds).\n   Cachectic. Tachypneic, not in distress. Nose-breathing but +\n   retractions, accessory muscles. Right anterior wheezing, left faint,\n   rare rhonchi. Cardiac RRR. Mild (1+) edema at feet only. No rashes,\n   mild erythema at coccyx. Echo ongoing so deferred neuro exam, but\n   patient had nl spont movement. Abd NABS soft, NDNT.\n    CXR hyperinflated, right sided opac- dense UL, right effusion. Left\n   clear.\n   WBC 24 (inc from 19K)\n          Resp distress: I believe this is most likely from his\n   pleural effusion which was inadequately drained yesterday. Only 550cc\n   removed, because pt c/o chest pain (related to reexpansion, not\n   cardiac). Will drain via pleurX again now.\n          Issue of working up TB: [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 344**]\nt think there is a compelling\n   reason to r/o TB at this point. Pt has had weight loss and now has resp\n   failure, opacification on CXR but these are attributable to widespread\n   metastatic NSCLC and postobstructive pna. It would be reassuring to\n   obtain results of prior TB testing, if available from his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **]\n   [**Name12 (NameIs) 344**]\nt think he can tolerate induction for sputum collection or bronch,\n   and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 344**]\nt think it is clinically necessary now.\n          Vanc/zosyn for post-obstructive pna. (Recently completed\n   levoflox/flagyl 7d for postobstructive pna.)\n          Duonebs with COPD hx, though do not think he has COPD\n   exacerbation.\n   Other issues per MICU team note above.\n   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 101**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 65**], MD\n   on:[**2145-11-20**] 15:48 ------\n"

He was\n   diagnosed with lung cancer in [**2145-8-31**] now follows with Dr.\n   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 9428**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital 52**] Hospital. In [**Month (only) 1374**] he developed acute cord\n   compression and had decompression on [**2145-10-15**].  Discharged to rehab.\n   He was readmitted to [**Hospital1 1**] from [**Date range (1) 9429**] for shortness of breath\n   with new finding of large right sided pleural effusion and a RUL post\n   obstructive pneumonia; mass abutting RUL bronchus and PA.  During last\n   admission he underwent thoracentesis and, later, pleurex catheter\n   placement on [**11-17**].  Pleural fluid positive for malignant cells, AFB\n   smear negative.  Also initiated palliative XRT to RUL.  IP did not feel\n   mass was amenable to stenting.  Notes in discharge summary state that\n   patient was DNR/DNI at discharge.\n   .\n   Patient was discharged to [**Hospital 183**] Rehab.  At rehab this morning it was\n   discovered that there were not appropriate supplies to drain pleurex.\n   Had his usual session XRT this AM.  He also had CXR which was read as\n   complete R sided opacification.  When arrived back at rehab, he was\n   sent to the ED due to inability to drain the effusion.\n   .\n   In the ED, initial vs were: T96.8 70 146/88 22 96% on 15L O2.

CXR performed with finding of interval increase in\n   pleural effusion and R lung base opacificition.  IP saw patient and\n   drained 550 cc fluid from patient's pleurex catheter.  A bedside\n   ultrasound was obtained showing no pericardial effusion.  Patient was\n   given vancomycin and zosyn.  Attempts were made to contact interpreter\n   but this was not possible - could not confirm DNR status and seemed to\n   suggest that patient was full code.\n   .\n   In the MICU, patient interviewed with an interpreter.

Large right upper lobe mass with post-obstructive lung\n   collapse and cavitating pneumonia as seen on prior exam. There is\n   abrupt termination of the right upper lobe bronchus and right upper\n   lobe pulmonary artery due to mass lesion.\n   2. Small right infrahilar mass which encases the right lower\n   lobe pulmonary arteries and right inferior pulmonary vein, although\n   these vessels remain patent.\n   3. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.\n   4. Extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\n   5. Left lung nodules, unchanged.\n   6. Metastatic involvement of the osseous structures, unchanged.\n   7. Pancreatic ductal dilatation and intra and extrahepatic biliary\n   dilatation is concerning for pancratic head mass.  There is an\n   expansile 3.5cm mass in the tail of the pancreas.  Liver hypodense\n   lesions, and renal hypodense lesions, incompletely characterized.\n   .\n   EKG: sinus tach at 129, NANI, low limb lead voltage with normal/high\n   precordial lead voltage.  TWF in I and aVL.  All unchanged from prior\n   (prior rate 115) from [**2145-11-18**].\n   Assessment and Plan\n   77M with metastatic lung cancer and malignant pleural effusion,\n   presenting with inability to drain pleurex catheter and admitted to\n   MICU with respiratory distress.\n   .\n   # Respiratory distress.  Likely multifactorial with lung malignancy,\n   postobstructive pneumonia and RUL atelectasis, malignant pleural\n   effusion.  Also consider PE in differential given malignancy history\n   and immobility.  Pericardial disease less likely with negative\n   ultrasound in ED, but still a consideration.  Patient appears dry\n   without much evidence of pulmonary edema.\n   - Daily/?continuous drainage of pleural space.\n   - Check formal TTE.\n   - Will obtain LENIs for DVT eval; if positive -> filter.  Risks of\n   anticoagulating for DVT or PE very high given location of mass and\n   proximity to pulmonary arterial system.\n   - Will continue antibiotics for postobstructive pneumonia, though\n   unlikely to be able to sterilize RUL given anatomy.\n   - Check flu swab.\n   - Expectorated sputum for AFB and culture (unlikely to tolerate induced\n   sputum with current respiratory status).\n   - Obtain records re: past AFB workup, ?bronch in the past.\n   - Continued goals of care discussion, as most of above irreversible\n   unless able to tolerate chemotherapy.  Discussed difficulties with\n   mechanical ventilation with patient and family (would be very difficult\n   to get off vent) - understood by patient and daughter and he wishes to\n   be DNR/DNI.\n   .\n   # Tachycardia.  Sinus tach in low 100s at times, increasing to ~150s in\n   MAT vs. Afib.  Likely related to primary pulmonary disease.  Also\n   consider PE and infection as above.\n   - Monitor on tele.\n   - Metoprolol 12.5 TID for now (given MAT), 5 IV working well initially\n   and can titrate PO if needed.\n   - Pain and dyspnea control.\n   .\n   # Pneumonia.  Post obstructive most likely.  s/p recent 7 day course of\n   levoflox and flagyl.  Very difficult to sterilize given post\n   obstructive nature.  Getting XRT to region; too ill for chemo at\n   present time.  Also consider TB given risk factors as above.\n   - continue vanc and zosyn for now.\n   - expectorated sputum.\n   - continued goals of care discussion.\n   .\n   # Metastatic lung cancer.  With known mets to spine; pleural disease.\n   Getting palliative XRT.  Patient understands grave prognosis but has\n   hope of slowing down the cancer.\n   - Palliative care consult.\n   - Can discuss again with onc re: any ability for palliative chemo.\n   - Supposed to resume XRT on Monday.\n   - pain control with MS Contin, morphine IV prn breakthrough\n   .\n   # Leukocytosis.  In patient with pneumonia, malignancy.  No fevers.\n   - Infectious workup as above.\n   - Send C.diff.\n   - Continue to trend.\n   .\n   FEN: 1L NS then reeval, replete electrolytes, regular diet, megace for\n   appetite stim.\n   Prophylaxis: [**Last Name (un) 9430**] (on at rehab)\n   Access: peripherals\n   Code:  DNR/DNI\n   Communication: Patient and daughter [**Name (NI) 9426**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9431**]\n   [**Name2 (NI) 1531**]osition: pending clinical improvement\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition: regular\n   Glycemic Control:\n   Lines:\n   18 Gauge - [**2145-11-19**] 05:30 PM\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT: [**Last Name (un) 9430**]\n   Stress ulcer: PPI\n   VAP:\n   Comments:\n   Communication:  Comments:\n   Code status: DNR/DNI\n   Disposition: ICU\n   ------ Protected Section ------\n   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU\n   team for the key portions of the services provided.

He was\n   diagnosed with lung cancer in [**2145-8-31**] now follows with Dr.\n   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 9428**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital 52**] Hospital. In [**Month (only) 1374**] he developed acute cord\n   compression and had decompression on [**2145-10-15**].  Discharged to rehab.\n   He was readmitted to [**Hospital1 1**] from [**Date range (1) 9429**] for shortness of breath\n   with new finding of large right sided pleural effusion and a RUL post\n   obstructive pneumonia; mass abutting RUL bronchus and PA.  During last\n   admission he underwent thoracentesis and, later, pleurex catheter\n   placement on [**11-17**].  Pleural fluid positive for malignant cells, AFB\n   smear negative.  Also initiated palliative XRT to RUL.  IP did not feel\n   mass was amenable to stenting.  Notes in discharge summary state that\n   patient was DNR/DNI at discharge.\n   .\n   Patient was discharged to [**Hospital 183**] Rehab.  At rehab this morning it was\n   discovered that there were not appropriate supplies to drain pleurex.\n   Had his usual session XRT this AM.  He also had CXR which was read as\n   complete R sided opacification.  When arrived back at rehab, he was\n   sent to the ED due to inability to drain the effusion.\n   .\n   In the ED, initial vs were: T96.8 70 146/88 22 96% on 15L O2.  HRs have\n   since been in the 130s - not clear if HR 70 truly accurate.  Has been\n   tachypneic to 30s.  CXR performed with finding of interval increase in\n   pleural effusion and R lung base opacificition.  IP saw patient and\n   drained 550 cc fluid from patient's pleurex catheter.  A bedside\n   ultrasound was obtained showing no pericardial effusion.  Patient was\n   given vancomycin and zosyn.  Attempts were made to contact interpreter\n   but this was not possible - could not confirm DNR status and seemed to\n   suggest that patient was full code.\n   .\n   In the MICU, patient interviewed with an interpreter.  Notes he gets\n   dyspneic at times but no different lately.  Actually denies shortness\n   of breath currently.  + cough, productive of white sputum, denies\n   hemoptysis.  No CP, no pleuritic pain.  Notes occasional palpitations.\n   No fevers/chills.  Endorses thirst and general poor PO intake.

Risks of\n   anticoagulating for DVT or PE very high given location of mass and\n   proximity to pulmonary arterial system.\n   - Will continue antibiotics for postobstructive pneumonia, though\n   unlikely to be able to sterilize RUL given anatomy.\n   - Check flu swab.\n   - Expectorated sputum for AFB and culture (unlikely to tolerate induced\n   sputum with current respiratory status).\n   - Obtain records re: past AFB workup, ?bronch in the past.\n   - Continued goals of care discussion, as most of above irreversible\n   unless able to tolerate chemotherapy.  Discussed difficulties with\n   mechanical ventilation with patient and family (would be very difficult\n   to get off vent) - understood by patient and daughter and he wishes to\n   be DNR/DNI.\n   .\n   # Tachycardia.  Sinus tach in low 100s at times, increasing to ~150s in\n   MAT vs. Afib.  Likely related to primary pulmonary disease.  Also\n   consider PE and infection as above.\n   - Monitor on tele.\n   - Metoprolol 12.5 TID for now (given MAT), 5 IV working well initially\n   and can titrate PO if needed.\n   - Pain and dyspnea control.\n   .\n   # Pneumonia.  Post obstructive most likely.  s/p recent 7 day course of\n   levoflox and flagyl.  Very difficult to sterilize given post\n   obstructive nature.  Getting XRT to region; too ill for chemo at\n   present time.  Also consider TB given risk factors as above.\n   - continue vanc and zosyn for now.\n   - expectorated sputum.\n   - continued goals of care discussion.\n   .\n   # Metastatic lung cancer.  With known mets to spine; pleural disease.\n   Getting palliative XRT.

Tachycardia.\nWeight (lb): 99\nBP (mm Hg): 117/59\nHR (bpm): 105\nStatus: Inpatient\nDate/Time: [**2145-11-20**] at 10:59\nTest: Portable TTE (Complete)\nDoppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler\nContrast: None\nTechnical Quality: Adequate\n\n\nINTERPRETATION:\n\nFindings:\n\nLEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA and RA cavity sizes.\n\nRIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal IVC diameter (<2.1cm) with >55%\ndecrease during respiration (estimated RA pressure (0-5mmHg).\n\nLEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Mild global LV\nhypokinesis. Relatively preserved apical LV contraction. TDI E/e' < 8,\nsuggesting normal PCWP (<12mmHg). No resting LVOT gradient.\n\nRIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.\n\nAORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level.\n\nAORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Trace AR.\n\nMITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.\n\nTRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to moderate [[**1-1**]+] TR.\nMild PA systolic hypertension.\n\nPULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized. No PS.\nPhysiologic PR.\n\nPERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.\n\nGENERAL COMMENTS: Left pleural effusion.\n\nConclusions:\nThe left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The estimated\nright atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and\ncavity size are normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis\n(LVEF = 45 %). Systolic function of apical segments is relatively preserved\nsuggesting a non-ischemic etiology. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber\nsize and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly\nthickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is\nseen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral\nregurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is\na trivial anterior pericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild global hypokinesis\nc/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc.). Mild pulmonary artery systolic\nhypertension.\n\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:\nBased on [**2142**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings\nindicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical decisions regarding the need\nfor prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.\n\n\n"

He was\n   diagnosed with lung cancer in [**2145-8-31**] now follows with Dr.\n   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 9428**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital 52**] Hospital. In [**Month (only) 1374**] he developed acute cord\n   compression and had decompression on [**2145-10-15**].  Discharged to rehab.\n   He was readmitted to [**Hospital1 1**] from [**Date range (1) 9429**] for shortness of breath\n   with new finding of large right sided pleural effusion and a RUL post\n   obstructive pneumonia; mass abutting RUL bronchus and PA.  During last\n   admission he underwent thoracentesis and, later, pleurex catheter\n   placement on [**11-17**].  Pleural fluid positive for malignant cells, AFB\n   smear negative.  Also initiated palliative XRT to RUL.  IP did not feel\n   mass was amenable to stenting.  Notes in discharge summary state that\n   patient was DNR/DNI at discharge.\n   .\n   Patient was discharged to [**Hospital 183**] Rehab.  At rehab this morning it was\n   discovered that there were not appropriate supplies to drain pleurex.\n   Had his usual session XRT this AM.  He also had CXR which was read as\n   complete R sided opacification.  When arrived back at rehab, he was\n   sent to the ED due to inability to drain the effusion.\n   .\n   In the ED, initial vs were: T96.8 70 146/88 22 96% on 15L O2.  HRs have\n   since been in the 130s - not clear if HR 70 truly accurate.  Has been\n   tachypneic to 30s.  CXR performed with finding of interval increase in\n   pleural effusion and R lung base opacificition.  IP saw patient and\n   drained 550 cc fluid from patient's pleurex catheter.  A bedside\n   ultrasound was obtained showing no pericardial effusion.  Patient was\n   given vancomycin and zosyn.  Attempts were made to contact interpreter\n   but this was not possible - could not confirm DNR status and seemed to\n   suggest that patient was full code.\n   .\n   In the MICU, patient interviewed with an interpreter.  Notes he gets\n   dyspneic at times but no different lately.  Actually denies shortness\n   of breath currently.  + cough, productive of white sputum, denies\n   hemoptysis.  No CP, no pleuritic pain.  Notes occasional palpitations.\n   No fevers/chills.  Endorses thirst and general poor PO intake.

Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.\n   4. Extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\n   5. Left lung nodules, unchanged.\n   6. Metastatic involvement of the osseous structures, unchanged.\n   7. Pancreatic ductal dilatation and intra and extrahepatic biliary\n   dilatation is concerning for pancratic head mass.

Likely multifactorial with lung malignancy,\n   postobstructive pneumonia and RUL atelectasis, malignant pleural\n   effusion.  Also consider PE in differential given malignancy history\n   and immobility.  Pericardial disease less likely with negative\n   ultrasound in ED, but still a consideration.  Patient appears dry\n   without much evidence of pulmonary edema.\n   - Daily/?continuous drainage of pleural space.\n   - Check formal TTE.\n   - Will obtain LENIs for DVT eval; if positive -> filter.  Risks of\n   anticoagulating for DVT or PE very high given location of mass and\n   proximity to pulmonary arterial system.\n   - Will continue antibiotics for postobstructive pneumonia, though\n   unlikely to be able to sterilize RUL given anatomy.\n   - Check flu swab.\n   - Expectorated sputum for AFB and culture (unlikely to tolerate induced\n   sputum with current respiratory status).\n   - Obtain records re: past AFB workup, ?bronch in the past.\n   - Continued goals of care discussion, as most of above irreversible\n   unless able to tolerate chemotherapy.  Discussed difficulties with\n   mechanical ventilation with patient and family (would be very difficult\n   to get off vent) - understood by patient and daughter and he wishes to\n   be DNR/DNI.\n   .\n   # Tachycardia.  Sinus tach in low 100s at times, increasing to ~150s in\n   MAT vs. Afib.  Likely related to primary pulmonary disease.  Also\n   consider PE and infection as above.\n   - Monitor on tele.\n   - Metoprolol 12.5 TID for now (given MAT), 5 IV working well initially\n   and can titrate PO if needed.\n   - Pain and dyspnea control.\n   .\n   # Pneumonia.  Post obstructive most likely.  s/p recent 7 day course of\n   levoflox and flagyl.  Very difficult to sterilize given post\n   obstructive nature.  Getting XRT to region; too ill for chemo at\n   present time.  Also consider TB given risk factors as above.\n   - continue vanc and zosyn for now.\n   - expectorated sputum.\n   - continued goals of care discussion.\n   .\n   # Metastatic lung cancer.  With known mets to spine; pleural disease.\n   Getting palliative XRT.  Patient understands grave prognosis but has\n   hope of slowing down the cancer.\n   - Palliative care consult.\n   - Can discuss again with onc re: any ability for palliative chemo.\n   - Supposed to resume XRT on Monday.\n   - pain control with MS Contin, morphine IV prn breakthrough\n   .\n   # Leukocytosis.  In patient with pneumonia, malignancy.  No fevers.\n   - Infectious workup as above.\n   - Send C.diff.\n   - Continue to trend.\n   .\n   FEN: 1L NS then reeval, replete electrolytes, regular diet, megace for\n   appetite stim.\n   Prophylaxis: [**Last Name (un) 9430**] (on at rehab)\n   Access: peripherals\n   Code:  DNR/DNI\n   Communication: Patient and daughter [**Name (NI) 9426**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9431**]\n   [**Name2 (NI) 1531**]osition: pending clinical improvement\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition: regular\n   Glycemic Control:\n   Lines:\n   18 Gauge - [**2145-11-19**] 05:30 PM\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT: [**Last Name (un) 9430**]\n   Stress ulcer: PPI\n   VAP:\n   Comments:\n   Communication:  Comments:\n   Code status: DNR/DNI\n   Disposition: ICU\nReferences\n   1.

In [**Month (only) 359**] he developed acute cord compression and had\ndecompression on [**2145-10-15**]. Discharged to rehab. He was\nreadmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 56568**] for shortness of breath\nwith new finding of large right sided pleural effusion and a RUL\npost obstructive pneumonia; mass abutting RUL bronchus and PA.\nDuring last admission he underwent thoracentesis and, later,\npleurex catheter placement on [**11-17**]. Pleural fluid positive for\nmalignant cells, AFB smear negative. Also initiated palliative\nXRT to RUL. IP did not feel mass was amenable to stenting. Notes\nin discharge summary state that patient was DNR/DNI at\ndischarge.\n\nPatient was discharged to [**Hospital 392**] Rehab. At rehab this morning it\nwas discovered that there were not appropriate supplies to drain\npleurex. Had his usual session XRT this AM. He also had CXR\nwhich was read as complete R sided opacification. When arrived\nback at rehab, he was sent to the ED due to inability to drain\nthe effusion.\n\nIn the ED, initial vs were: T96.8 70 146/88 22 96% on 15L O2.\nHRs have since been in the 130s - not clear if HR 70 truly\naccurate.

IP saw patient and drained 550 cc fluid from\npatient's pleurex catheter. A bedside ultrasound was obtained\nshowing no pericardial effusion. Patient was given vancomycin\nand zosyn. Attempts were made to contact interpreter but this\nwas not possible - could not confirm DNR status and seemed to\nsuggest that patient was full code.\n\nIn the MICU, patient interviewed with an interpreter.

The\nestimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular\nwall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild\nglobal left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 %). Systolic\nfunction of apical segments is relatively preserved suggesting a\nnon-ischemic etiology. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic\nstenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral\nregurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic\nhypertension. There is a trivial anterior pericardial effusion.\nIMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild global\nhypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc.). Mild\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension.\n\n[**2145-11-20**] Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound:\nPeroneal veins not visualized. No evidence of deep venous\nthrombosis.\n\n[**2145-11-21**] Chest Xray\nThere is essentially no change in chest findings with right\nupper lobe\ncomplete opacification, right pleural effusion, ground-glass\nopacity and\nmass-like consolidation in the right lower lobe, nodular opacity\nprojecting in the left upper lobe and peribronchial\nabnormalities in the left lower lobe or due to patient's known\nnon-small cell lung cancer. There are no new lung abnormalities.\nCardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Right apical chest\ntube remains in place. Spinal hardware is present. There is no\npneumothorax.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n77 year old male with metastatic lung cancer and malignant\npleural effusion admitted for pleural catheter drainage.\n\n# Pleurex catheter drainage: He initially presented to the\nemergency room after a radiation oncology appointment and\ninability to drain pleurex at rehab facility.  Per son, this was\nlikely due to not accessing pleurex catheter appropriately.  In\ntotal, patient has had approximately 2500 cc of fluid removed\nduring his stay.  He was initially admitted overnight to the\nMICU after experiencing shortness of breath, tachypnea and\nhypoxia in the emergency room; however, this quickly resolved.\n\n# Shortness of Breath: He has baseline shortness of breath due\nto persistent malignant effusion and post-obstructive pneumonia\nsecondary to mass.  Resolved with drainage of pleurex catheter.\nThis should be drained daily after discharge.  Information\nprovided to nursing director at [**Hospital 392**] rehab by interventional\npulmonary service and video is sent with patient.  Please call\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 3020**] if any questions or concerns regarding drainage.\n\n# Pneumonia/Hypoxia: Patient completed a course for\npost-obstructive pneumonia and other than leukocytosis as below\nhas no other signs or symptoms of infection.  Has been C. diff\nnegative during this admission.  UA negative, CXR without new\nfindings, C. diff negative as above, blood cultures are no\ngrowth to date and patient ruled out for flu, parainfluenza,\nadenovirus and RSV.  Tachypnea and hypoxia improved as above\nwith drainage of pleurex.   LENIs negative as well making PE\nless likely.  He was given a few doses of vancomycin and\ncefepime while in the intensive care unit, but these were\ndiscontinued upon transfer to the floor.\n\n# Stage IV NSCL and Malignant effusion: Known mets to spine and\nmalignant effusion. Already undergoing palliative xrt, last dose\ntoday. Too debilitated for chemo at this time.  We continued\npain control as per prior to admission.  Follow up scheduled\nwith oncology service as per discharge paperwork.\n\n# Leukocytosis: C. diff negative, CXR unchanged other than\neffusion, UA negative and blood cultures no growth to date.\nPatient remained afebrile and non-toxic appearing, though\nchronically ill.  [**Month (only) 116**] be secondary to malignancy.\n\n# Tachycardia: Sinus tach vs MAT.  No clear Afib history and he\nwas intermittently irregular making MAT more likely (though\ndifficult to appreciate p waves when accelerated rhyhtm).  Rate\ncontrolled with metoprolol which was increased to 37.5 mg three\ntimes daily.\n\n# Prophylaxis: Continued on fondaparinux, ppi\n\n# Code status: DNR/I\n\n# Communication: Liping (daughter) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 84933**], [**Name (NI) **] (son)\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 84934**]\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\n- Morphine SR 15 mg Q12H\n- Acetaminophen 325 mg Q6H as needed for pain, fever.\n- roxanol 0.25 ml Q3H prn pain\n- Omeprazole 40 mg DAILY\n- Guaifenesin 100 mg/5 mL: 5-10 MLs PO Q6H as needed for cough.\n\n- Benzonatate 100 mg TID\n- Megestrol 400 mg/10 mL : Twenty (20) ml PO once a day.\n- Fondaparinux 2.5 mg Subcutaneous once a day.\n- Albuterol Sulfate [**1-1**] nebs Q4H prn shortness of breath or\nwheeze.\n- Catheter Drainage Please drain IP catheter three times/wk\n- Docusate Sodium 100 mg twice a day.\n- Senna 8.6 mgTwo (2) Tablet PO twice a day\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
