Per staff at her nursing home she was in her\n   usual state of health until the day prior to presentation when she\n   began to complain of back pain.  She was unable to clarify further.\n   Her temperature was 100.4 with blood pressure 162/82.  She received\n   vicodin and tylenol without improvement.  At baseline she is alert,\n   oriented but does not ambulate.  She is able to eat by herself but is\n   incontinent of urine and stools.  She was transferred to [**Hospital3 389**]\n   for further management.\n   In the ED, initial vs were: T: 98.0 P: 90 BP: 104/69 R: 16 O2 sat: 92%\n   on RA. She became tachycardic to the 140s (sinus tachycardia) with\n   stable blood pressures and spiked a fever to 101.5.  Her antibiotics\n   were broadened to vancomycin and cefepime and she had a CT of the chest\n   with contrast which was not timed appropriately and did not show a\n   large pulmonary embolism but could not rule out a small pulmonary\n   embolism. She also received 2 mg morphine, tylenol, ciprofloxacin 500\n   mg x 1, morphine 2 mg IV x 1 and haldol 2.5 mg IV x 1.  She received 2\n   liters of IV with improvement in her heart rate to the high 100s.  She\n   was admitted to the ICU for further management.\n   On the floor, she is unable to clarify further.  She says that she has\n   been having back pain for 2-3 days.  The pain is in her bilateral\n   back.  It is worse with movement.  It was not associated with any\n   trauma that she recalls.  She denies fevers, chills, lightheadedness,\n   dizziness, chest pain, difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting,\n   abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain or\n   swelling.\n   Patient admitted from: [**Hospital1 5**] ER\n   History obtained from [**Hospital 19**] Medical records\n   Allergies:\n   No Known Drug Allergies\n   Last dose of Antibiotics:\n   Cefipime - [**2139-7-8**] 12:00 AM\n   Vancomycin - [**2139-7-8**] 01:00 AM\n   Infusions:\n   Other ICU medications:\n   Other medications:\n   Home Medications:\n   Cymbalta 30 mg daily\n   Folic Acid 1 mg daily\n   Loratadine 10 mg daily\n   Multivitamin\n   Thiamine 100mg daily\n   Simvastatin 40 mg dialy\n   Vicodin 5-500 [**Hospital1 **] and Q4H:PRN\n   Namenda 10 mg [**Hospital1 **]\n   Lorazepam 0.5 mg Q6H:PRN\n   Prochlorperazine 10 mg Q6H:PRN\n   Tylenol 650 mg PRN\n   Milk of Magnesia 400 mg daily:PRN\n   Bisacodyl 10 mg PR daily:PRN\n   Fleets enema PRN\n   Senna PRN\n   Calcium 500 mg TId\n   Detrol 4 mg QHS\n   Aricept 10 mg QHS\n   Levothyroxine 125 mcg daily\n   Colace\n   Aspirin 325 mg daily\n   Vitamin D 50,000 q month\n   Past medical history:\n   Family history:\n   Social History:\n   Multiple sclerosis\n   Coronary Artery Disease\n   Hypertension\n   Hyperlipidemia\n   Osteoporosis\n   Hypothyroidism\n   Depression\n   Chronic sinusitis and allergic rhinitis.\n   Endometriosis, status post laparoscopy.\n   Dysfunctional uterine bleeding\n   Coronary artery disease in brother.

Exam notable for bilateral paraspinal\n   tenderness with normal strength and sensation on exam.  Spiked a\n   temperature in the emergency room with associated tachycardia.\n   Although urinarlysis is positive, bilateral nature makes pyelonephritis\n   unlikely.  Most concerning etiology of back pain would be epidural\n   abscess but lack of findings on neurologic exam and significant\n   paraspinal muscle tenderness makes this less likely.  Most likely\n   etiology would be musculoskeletal back pain but this is a diagnosis of\n   exclusion.

Dilated loops of small bowel are\nnoted. Multiple air- fluid levels are noted on left lateral\ndecubitus. Colon is noted to be filled with air throughout the\ncolon. Overall findings are consistent with ileus.\nIMPRESSION: Dilated loops of small bowel with air noted\nthroughout colon\nconsistent with ileus. Gastric distension is once again noted in\nthis study.\n\nABD US ON [**2139-7-13**]: There is no focal liver lesion identified.\nThere is no biliary dilatation and the common duct measures .6\ncm.

Given history of osteoporosis, compression\nfracture was also in the differential but preliminarily no\nevidence on CT chest. MRI T&L done on [**2139-7-9**] which showed no\nacute processes. She was given broad spectrum antibiotics\nincluding:  ciprofloxacin and ceftaxine were given x1, Vanco IV\nx 2 days until her blood culture results were available. She was\nfoud to have MSSA so she was started on Nafcillin 2 gm IV Q4\nhrs, from [**7-10**]->[**7-13**]. Nafcillin was stopped due to increased in\nLFTs, RUQ abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. She was started\non Cefazolin 2 gm IV Q 8hrs. Patient's condition had overall\nimproved, her confusion resolved on the second day of admission\nalthough she has Alzheimers at baseline. She states to always\nhave a baseline backpain, but it was much improved from\nadmission. Pt was also found to have a UTI + E.Coli which she\nwas treated for a total of 3 days, urine culture was repeated on\n[**7-11**] which was negative.\n\nPatient also has been followed by infectious diseases who gave\nantibiotic recommendations. She had a PICC line placed on\n[**2139-7-13**] which she had removed after the first day, she stated\nthat if was ictching and she pulled it out. She had another PICC\nreplaced on her Right AC which was working well prior to\ndischarge.\n.\n# Nausea and vomiting: pt complained of nausea and vomited a\nsmall amount of greenish fluid on [**2138-7-12**] and [**7-13**]. she also had\ntenderness on her right upper quad. Abdominal US showed\ncholelithiasis without cholecystitis. Since Naficillin can cause\nsome liver toxicity, the medication was discontinued.\nTransaminitis started to trend down. However, on [**2139-7-14**]\npatient's abdomen looked distended, tympanic, and she continued\nto complaint of RUQ abdominal pain. She had increased liquid BMs\nfor the prior 2 days which were attributed to motility agents\nshe had received. Given that she was in numerous antibiotics,\nstool was sent for C-Diff and place her on prophylactic Flagyl\n500mg PO. We also did a KUB which showed an ileus. This was most\nlikely related to an functional ileus, since she was on\nnarcotics, laying in bed with decreased mobility, and no BM for\na 4-5 days prior to receiving motility agents. She was made NPO\nfor 1 day. On physical exam her abdomen on the following day was\nsoft, continued to be mildly distended, but less tender. + BS x\n4 quads and she had two BMs. We advanced her diet. She has been\ntolerating her diet well with no N/v and no complain of\nabdominal pain.\nHer C-diff culture was negative and her Flagyl was D/c on\n[**2139-7-16**].\n\n#TRANSMIANITIS: As noted above she had sl. increase in AST, ALT\nand Alk phos with nausea and vomiting for 2 days and RUQ\ntenderness. This was thought to be related to the Nafcillin.\nOnce Nafcillin was D/c'd and labs started to trend down. She was\nalso found to have increase in Lipase of 79  and amylase of 113\non [**7-16**] . This was believed to be caused by mild pancreatitis\nalso related to prior treatment administration of Nafcillin. She\nwill have continue monitoring of LFTs, including lipase and\namylase weekly. She was doing well at discharge, tolerating her\nregular diet with no complains of N/V or abdominal pain.\n\n.\n#UTI: Urine culture Positive for E.Coli > 100,000 colonies,\nrresistant to cipro and ampicillin. Sensitive to the\ncefalosporins, zozyn, tobramycin, Bactrim, and Nitrofurantoin.\nReceived 3 days of Bactrim. D/c on [**7-11**]. Repeat UA on [**7-11**].\nUrine culture on [**7-11**] shows no growth.\n.\n#Tachycardia: Patient has been sinus tachycardic for most of her\nadmission. EKG remained unchanged, she was placed on tele for\nthe first few day of admission where she remained on sinus tachy\nin rates ranging from 90s to low 100s, asymptomatic. This could\nbe due to mild hyperthyroidism, TSH low 0.08 and on\nlevothryroxine. Patient also given extra fluid bolus which she\nresponded well, so could also be due to dehydration. Patient\nstable at time of discharge. Follow TSH and T4 as outpaint\nencourage PO fluids.\n.\n# 2nd degree right buttock ulcer: Patient with small 2x1 cm in\ndiameter excoriation on right buttock. The wound care nurse\nassessed and treated the wound. The wound has overall improved,\nnow there is only very small wound healing well less than .5cm\nin diameter at the time of discharge with dressing over it.\n.\n#Coronary Artery Disease: No changes on EKG.\n- continue aspirin 81 mg daily\n.\nAt discharge: Patient is alert and oriented times place and\ntime. She respond appropriately to questions, and conversing.\nVery pleasant. She moves in bed with minimal assist. She is\nincontinent of urine and stool which is her baseline.

Most concerning etiology of back pain would be epidural\n   abscess but lack of findings on neurologic exam and significant\n   paraspinal muscle tenderness makes this less likely.  Most likely\n   etiology would be musculoskeletal back pain but this is a diagnosis of\n   exclusion.
