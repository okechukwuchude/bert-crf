Pt. had a paracentesis (9.5L) on\nthursday and afterwards had been feeling somewhat tired as\nnormal for him after a paracentesis. He continued to feel tired\nuntil 0300 this am when he vomited, he went back to bed and then\nbegan having dry heaves around 0600. At this time his wife\nchecked him for asterixis and she noted that he did have a\nflapping tremor and she brought him to the ED. She noted that he\nhad had 4 BMs yesterday. He was admitted from the ED w/o workup.\nOn the floor he was lethargic but arousable and he was taken for\nabdominal u/s w/ IR paracentesis. ON presentation he only\ncomplains of thirst.\n\nPast Medical History:\n1) Etoh cirrhosis, diagnosed in '[**82**], transplant candidate (may\nneed liver-kidney), complicated by:\n- variceal bleeding in '[**83**], controlled with medications\n- ascites requiring periodic paracenteses\n- ?

On\n[**2187-10-11**] he underwent Orthotopic deceased-donor liver transplant\n(piggyback); portal vein to portal vein anastomosis; common bile\nduct to common bile duct anastomosis with no T-tube; celiac\npatch (donor) with replaced right hepatic artery to a branch\npatch (recipient for Alcoholic cirrhosis; portal hypertension;\nascites; chronic renal failure; aortic stenosis. Surgeon was Dr.\n[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] assisted by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Two JPs were\nplaced. There were no complications. He then underwent cadaveric\nkidney transplant into the right\niliac fossa with placement of a 6-French double-J stent. Surgeon\nwas Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain was placed in the\nretroperitoneum. Please see both operative reports for complete\ndetails. Standard immunosuppressive induction therapy was given\n(solumedrol and cellcept).\n\nPostop, he was transferred to the SICU for postop management.\nPrograf was started on pod 1. He was extubated on [**10-14**] after\nbronchoscopy for LLL atelectasis. Platelets trended down.\nHeparin was stopped and a HIT was sent which was negative.\nMultiple blood products were given over SICU stay to maintain\nhemostasis.  Platelet count stabilized. Creatinine and LFTS\ntrended down. Urine output was excellent. Diet was advanced and\ntolerated. Glucoses were elevated from the solumedrol. An\ninsulin drip was initially used then sliding scale insulin was\ninitiated. [**Last Name (un) **] was later consulted and NPH with sliding scale\nwas used.\n\nHe was transferred out of the SICU to the Med-[**Doctor First Name **] floor on\n[**10-15**] where he continued to do well. He was assisted to\nambulate. PT followed him. The foley was removed with incident.\nThe 2 JPs and the [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain outputs were in the 20-60cc range.\nPain was well managed with oxycodone. Solumedrol was tapered,\ncellcept was adjusted to 500mg qid for some GI complaints and\nprograf was adjusted daily per trough levels.\n\nOn POD 7, the NEOB called to report that the donor had had an\nE.coli bacteremia. Given this, blood cultures were drawn for\nsurveillance. These returned + for coag negative staph. IV Vanco\nwas started and continued for 2 days. Blood, urine and the RLQ\nretroperitoneal [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain fluid cultures were positive for E.\ncoli. Initially, cipro was started for the urine. Dapto was\nstarted for a surveillance rectal swab that returned postive for\nVRE. This was only given for two days, then stopped on [**10-23**].\nMeropenum was started on [**11-23**] and continued thru [**10-26**]. ID was\nconsulted and recommended resuming Cipro. This was continued\nuntil ID re-evaluated and felt that he should remain on IV\nantibiotics for a 10 day course given h/o aortic valve stenosis,\nimmunosuppression. Ceftriaxone was started on [**10-29**] and continued\nuntil [**11-2**]. A PICC line was inserted and the plan was for a 10\nday course. Given known aortic stenosis and development of sinus\ntachycardia, a TTE was done to assess for vegetations. This was\nnegative. He then had a TEE to definitively rule out any\nvegetation. This was negative.\n\nAround POD 6, the medial JP and the [**Doctor Last Name 406**] (kidney) drainage\nincreased requiring IV fluid replacements. The 2 JPs around the\nliver were removed on POD 8 & 14. Creatinine of this fluid was\n1.7. Serum creatinine was 1.1. On POD 11 ([**10-23**]), urine output\nincreased to 3 liters. IV fluid replacement was given. He\ndeveloped dizziness, orthostatic hypotension with tachycardia\nand a sense that his heart was racing. He denied sob or chest\npain. This was initially treated with aggressive IV volume\nresuscitation. He continued to have sinus tachycardia.\nCardiology was consulted and IV lopressor was started. Sinus\ntach improved and lopressor was switched to Toprol 100mg qd.\nDuring this time his only complaint was fatigue that improved as\nheart rate was controlled.\n\nOn POD 11, an MRCP was done to evaluate elevated alk phos that\nhad been running in the 300-400 range. There was no evidence of\nbiliary dilatation. A small amount of ascites was noted. Alk\nphos improved some with daily range between 240-280. Alt and AST\nsomewhat increased. A duplex of the liver was done showing\nnormal vascular flow, no biliary dilatation or peri-hepatic\ncollections. On [**11-2**], an US guided biopsy was done to evaluate\nfor rejection given persistent elevation of LFTS. The biopsy was\nnegative.\n\nOn [**11-2**], he was discharged home to complete the Ceftriaxone\ncourse for 5 more day. VNA services were arranged. Blood\ncultures were to be done 72 hours after completing the\nCeftriaxone.\n\nStaples were removed from the subcostal incision as well as the\nRLQ incision. These incisions were clean, dry and intact. Vital\nsigns were stable with HRs in the 70-80s. He was ambulatory and\ntolerating a carb consistent diet.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1.
