He\nreports that he presented to his PCP's for a scheduled follow up\nvisit but otherwise was without specific complaints.  He does\nendorse weight gain of 21 pounds since his hospital discharge on\n[**9-11**].  Due to this he took some of his wifes water pills, the\nname he cant remember for three doses total.  Otherwise he\nreports recent decrease in his total daily naproxen dose and\nslight increase in his tramadol dose.  He has recently been\ntaking Bactrim and Augmentin following surgical debridement\n\nRecent admission [**Date range (1) 27372**] to vascular surgery service for right\ngroin mass c/w abscess on CTA without any evidence of\ncommunication with prior right CIA to SFA graft.  He had\nultrasound guided drainage which showed purulent material so he\nwas taken to the OR for surgical debridement.  He was discharged\non bactrim and augmentin with a wound vac in place.\n\nIn the ED, initial vs were: T 98 P 58 BP 118/46 R 18 O2 sat 100%\nRA.  Potassium was checked in the ED and was noted to be 7.8.\nPatient was given calcium gluconate 1g IV x1, insulin 10 units\nx1, D50 x 1 amp, bicarb x1amp and kayexalate 30g po.  He had an\nEKG which showed PR prolongation compared with baseline but no\nother changes.  Following this therapy he became\nasymptomatically hypoglycemic with decrease in blood sugar to 56\nfrom 114 on arrival and he was given a second amp of D50.\nRepeat glucose three hours later was persistently low at 40 and\nhe was given a third amp of d50.  He reports being asymptomatic\nwith all of these levels.\n\nOn the floor, he reports feeling at his baseline.  His FSBG was\n100 on arrival.\n\nReview of sytems:\n(+) Per HPI\n(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats.  Denied cough, he does\nendorse occasional dyspnea on exertion. Denied chest pain or\ntightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,\nconstipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or\nbladder habits.

Unclear etiology, but  differential diagnoses\ninclude adrenal insufficiency given hyponatremia, hyperkalemia,\nand peripheral eosinophilia. However, he does not have\nhypotension. Morning cortisol was within normal limits.  Other\nconsideration would be hyperkalemia associated with metabolic\nacidosis, although ph normal on ABG. Another consideration was\nrenal tubular acidosis given elevated potassium and low serum\nbicarbonate on admission.  No evidence of tissue breakdown or\nhemolysis with normal CK.  Hypoaldosteronism was also a possible\ncause, however he was not volume depleted on examination.\nTranstubular potassium gradient was 2.5, suggesting that\npatient's hyperkalemia was likely secondary to\nhypoaldosteronism. Renal was consulted who suggested that\nhyperkalemia was likely due to renal K secretion inhibition by\nmultiple medications (benzapril, [**Last Name (un) **], triamtereme, nsaids,\nbactrim). All were discontinued. IV lasix was started to enhance\nK secretion and remove volume.  On discussion with ID, patient's\nbactrim was replaced with linezolid. Pt's K currently corrected\nto 4.8, and he is being discharged on Lasix 10mg PO Daily.\n\n#MRSA abscess s/p surgical debridement with wound vac in place -\nPatient was evaluated by vascular surgery team in the ED, no\nacute issues. As bactrim may have played a role in patient's\nhyperkalemia, it was replaced with linezolid after discussing\nwith ID. given the risk for serotonin syndrome, his Tramadol was\ndiscontinued.\n\n#DM2 - Diabetes was very well controlled per history with last\nA1c in our system of 5.9.  Humalog sliding scale was continued,\nand NPH [**Hospital1 **] was held per patient's request.\n\n#Hypertension - Clonidine 0.3mg qam and 0.2mg qpm was continued\nwhile metoprolol and benicar were held in the setting of\nhyperkalemia. His blood pressures remained well-controlled.\n\n#PVD - Arterial insufficiency ulcers were seen on lower\nextremities bilaterally. Aspirin was continue during his stay in\nthe hospital.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nReconciled on [**2107-9-26**] [**Doctor Last Name **]\n\nLotrel (Amlodipine/benazepril) 5/20 QD\nBenicar (olmesartan/hctz) 40/25 one tab [**Hospital1 **]\nBactrim DS 160-800 mg One (1) Tablet PO BID x 4 weeks.\nAugmentin 875-125 mg one po tid (stopped [**9-22**])\nMetoprolol Tartrate 50 [**Hospital1 **]\nClonidine 0.3mg AM and 0.2mg PM\nPantoprazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]\nJanuvia (Sitagliptin) 100mg QD\nAspirin-Coated 325 mg PO QD\nNPH 2 units [**Hospital1 **]\nHumulin R 10 units AM, 8 NOON, 9 PM\nZetia 10mg [**Hospital1 **]\nNaproxen 220mg [**Hospital1 **]\nTramadol 50mg qam and 100mg qpm\nAspirin 325 mg PO DAILY\nProtonix Pantoprazole Sodium 40mg in the morning\nFerrous Sulfate Ferrous Sulfate 325(65)mg 1 time per day\nMultivitamin Multivitamins 1 per day\nVitamin C Ascorbic Acid 1000mg 1 per day\nVitamin B-6 Pyridoxine Hcl 100mg twice a day\nViactiv Ca Carbonate/vitamin D3/vit K 500-500-40 twice a day\nVitamin B12 Cyanocobalamin 100mcg 1 time per day\nVitamin E Vitamin E Acetate\nSuper B Complex Vitamin B Complex 1 per day\nGlucagon Emergency Kit Glucagon 1mg as directed\nFolic Acid Folic Acid 0.4mg take 1 tablet (0.4MG) by ORAL route\nevery day\nChromium Picolinate Calcium Phosphate/[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 27373**] [**Last Name (un) 27374**]\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
