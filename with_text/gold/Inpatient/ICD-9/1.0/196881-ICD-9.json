Right common femoral artery\n arteriogram and Angio-Seal closure of right common femoral artery.\n\n ANESTHESIA:  General.\n\n DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite.\n Anesthesia was induced.  Following this, both groins were prepped and draped\n in a sterile fashion.  Access was gained to the right common femoral artery\n using a Seldinger technique and a 6 French vascular sheath was placed in the\n right common femoral artery leading up into the distal aorta. This was\n connected to a continuous saline flush.  The left vertebral artery was\n catheterized with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 586**] 2 catheter, under roadmapping guidance.  The\n [**Doctor Last Name 586**] 2 catheter was exchanged out over an exchange length 0.038 Glidewire\n and a 6 French Neuron catheter was placed in the left vertebral artery.\n Following this, the aneurysm was catheterized with an SL-10 microcatheter and\n microwire. Coiling was commenced with a 4 mm 360 UltraSoft Target coil\n followed by 3 mm 360 UltraSoft Target coil followed by 2 mm 360 UltraSoft\n Target coil.  Following this, the aneurysm was obliterated except for a very\n small residual at the neck, which had to be maintained to keep the patency of\n the PICA artery.\n\n We now performed a right common femoral artery arteriogram . Since the artery\n was small, the sheath was left in place to be taken out later rather than\n using an Angioseal device.\n The ACT was maintained around 230 for the procedure.\n\n FINDINGS:  Left vertebral artery arteriogram reveals a 4.8 x 7.8 mm aneurysm\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2160-3-3**] 1:46 PM\n CAROT/CEREB [**Hospital1 **]                                                  Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 20240**]\n Reason: Coiling of aneurysmAnesthesia has been book for [**3-3**] on wait\n  Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 100ML OPTI240; 70ML OPTI320\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n arising at the PICA origin, incorporating the origin of the PICA vessel.\n\n Left vertebral artery arteriogram status post coiling shows complete\n obliteration of the aneurysm with a very small residual neck.\n\n Right common femoral arteriogram shows a small right common femoral artery.\n\n IMPRESSION:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 20241**] underwent cerebral arteriography and coil embolization\n of a PICA aneurysm which was uneventful.\n\n\n\n"
