Her family noted\nincreasing confusion x a few days, then yesterday she was noted\nto have some slurred speech and then this morning she couldn't\nspeak - could only say \"[**Last Name (un) 46536**]...\" and \"no.\" She was not able to\nbathe herself this AM as she forgot what to do.

Pt underwent a CT scan and\nMRI which showed the appearance of cystic lesion. Pt was started\non IV steroids and neurosurgery were consult. On the night of\nadmission pt underwent an open bone flap and drainage to assess\nwhether lesion was metastatic versus an infection. Pus was noted\nand drained noted to have brain abscess on biopsy/drainage\nperformed on [**2-18**]. Pt was then admitted and observed in the\nNeurosurgical ICU where she underwent a second procedure to\nremove her remaining rt sided lesion. Streptococcus Viridans was\ncultured and pt was started on a course of Vancomycin and then\ntransitioned to Ceftriaxone per Infectious disease\nrecommendations 2gm IV q 12hrs on [**2-26**]. Per Neurosurgery\nrecommendations pt was started on Keppra for seizure\nprophylaxis. Pt currently has two sutures in place at time of\ndischarge, the largest will dissolve, the second will need to be\nremoved during a follow up visit to Dr.[**Name (NI) 12757**] office on\n[**2151-3-8**] 11:30. Pt will need a repeat CT scan as an outpatient\nwhich has been scheduled for [**2151-3-23**] 2:00, after CT head scan\npt will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Pt will need a minimum of a 4 week\ncourse of Ceftriaxone 2gm IV q12hrs. Pt will have, during this\nduration, a follow up Infectious Disease Clinic appointment\nwhere they will decide whether she needs additional treatment.\nPt underwent a TTE that did not show any endocarditis.  TEE was\ndeferred as it would not change management and was felt to be a\nhigh risk\nprocedure per our cardiology team.  The most likely etiology of\nher brain abscesses is seeding from her lung infection (see\nbelow) or from endocarditis.\n\n## Lung Lesion: Pt underwent a biopsy of lung mass recently that\nwas positive for BOOP. As the possibility of malignancy still\nexisted the pt's RUL mass went to the bronchoscopy suite where\nshe underwent 6 biopsies, BAL, brush examination. Biopsies\nshowed alveolar and peribronchial tissue with mixed inflammatory\ninfiltrate, suggestive of acute pneumonia. Bronchial mucosa with\nmildly increased goblet cells and focal acute inflammation. No\nmalignancy was identified. Pt was discharged with a 7 day\nsteroid taper per Interventional Pulmonary.  Pt will f/u with a\nrepeat CT chest with contrast scan on [**2151-4-9**] 1030 to check the\nRUL mass.  Results will be faxed to Dr. [**Name (NI) 80585**], pt will follow\nup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 80585**] on [**2151-4-15**] 17:15.\n\n##. Mobility: Pt had bone flap removed for abscess drainage. She\nwill need to wear the helmet whenever she is mobile. She will\nlater need a graft however this will not be performed until\nseveral months from now.\n\n## Leukocytosis: Pt's WBC was noted to trend up and then down\nprior to discharge. Pt noted to have thrush as well as yeast in\nher urine. Pt was started on a 14 day course of oral\nFluconazole.\n- continue total 14 days Course of Fluconazole\n\n## Endometrial thickening: On CAT scan pt's endometrial lining.\nRecommend pt undergo a transvaginal U/S to evaluate endometrial\nthickening as an outpatient.\n\n## FEN: pt underwent bedside and swallow evaluation. Per speech\nand swallow recommendations pt was started and tolerated a soft\ndiet with thin liquids.\n\n## Psych: Pt has history of bipolar disorder, for which she\nusually takes Thoridazine. After discussion with Neurosurgery it\nwas decided that the Thoridazine would have a potential to\ninterfere with the pt's neurological examination. Pt will be\nre-evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**3-23**], at that time a decision\nwill be made whether Thoridazine can be restarted.\n- Recommend discussing with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**3-23**] whether pt can\nstart her Thoridazine again.\n\n## COPD: Pt noted intermittently to be wheezing on examination\nduring the first days of admission. Pt was discharged on\nTiotropium Bromide.\n\n## Code status: FULL CODE\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nPrednisone 20 mg Daily (Started [**2151-2-13**])\nGabapentin 300 mg TID\nHCTZ 25 mg Daily\nSimvistatin 20 mg Daily\nSpiriva 18 mg Daily\nAlbuterol\nBetaxolol Ophth Susp 0.25%\nThioridazine 40 mg qHS\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
