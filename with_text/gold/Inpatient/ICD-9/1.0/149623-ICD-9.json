His\nwork-up ultimately included MRI of the head that revealed a\nright parietal mass, as well as a small contrast enhancing\nregion in the left cerebellum consistent with metastasis.\nWork-up revealed a left upper lung mass as well. The patient\npresents for a combined mediastinoscopy as well as a right\ncraniotomy for tumor resection. The mediastinoscopy will be\nseparately dictated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nHTN\nHypercholesterolemia\nBPH (prostate bx 18 mo ago negative)\nSeasonal allergies\n\nSocial History:\nTobacco: remote 25 pack yr smoking history\nAlcohol: 2 beers per night\nIllicits: denies, no IVDA.\nNo herbal remedies.\n\n\nFamily History:\nFather - died of CHF aged 89\nMother - died of a stroke aged 73 (also had rheumatoid\narthritis)\n4 Siblings:\nNon-identical twin siblings: brother has ulcerative colitis and\n\nsister has diverticulitis\nOne sister died of AML aged 55\nA brother has OA\n\nPhysical Exam:\nA&Ox3, PERRL, follows commands, tongue midline, smile symmetric,\nno pronator drift. Strength is full [**5-31**]. Poor coordination of\nhis left hand (baseline)\n\nPertinent Results:\nMRI [**10-31**]:There is a new right frontal/parietal craniotomy.\nSubacute blood\nproducts are present at the site of the resected right frontal\nmass. There is hyperemia and mild linear enhancement along the\nmedial and superior margins of the surgical cavity. There is a\nsmall right subdural collection, a small right epidural\ncollection, and a small right subgaleal collection. Vasogenic\nedema in the right cerebral hemisphere has decreased in extent\ncompared to [**2106-10-11**]. A 4 mm enhancing mass in the\nleft cerebellar hemisphere is unchanged. A left parietal\ndevelopment venous anomaly is again seen. No new enhancing\nlesions are seen. The ventricles are normal in size.\n\nMRI [**10-29**]: Head Accounting for differences in head angulation and\npositioning, there is slight increase in the right parietal lobe\nmass but with decrease in the surrounding edema. The right\nfrontal lobe lesion currently measures 2.2 cm CC x 2.7 cm AP x\n2.5 cm TV dimensions compared to prior measurements of 2.2 x 1.7\nx 2.0 cm. There is less mass effect on the ventricles.\nThere is also a subtle enhancing lesion in the left cerebellum\nadjacent to\nthe tentorium. Ventricles and sulci are unchanged in size and\nconfiguration. There is no acute ischemia.\n\n[**2106-10-30**] 02:55AM BLOOD WBC-19.4*# RBC-4.45* Hgb-12.4* Hct-36.2*\nMCV-81* MCH-27.8 MCHC-34.1 RDW-14.2 Plt Ct-186\n[**2106-10-30**] 02:55AM BLOOD PT-12.3 PTT-22.0 INR(PT)-1.0\n[**2106-10-30**] 02:55AM BLOOD Glucose-179* UreaN-27* Creat-0.7 Na-134\nK-4.7 Cl-97 HCO3-27 AnGap-15\n[**2106-10-31**] 07:15AM BLOOD Phenyto-10.0\n[**2106-11-4**] 06:45AM BLOOD WBC-9.0 RBC-3.92* Hgb-11.1* Hct-31.9*\nMCV-81* MCH-28.3 MCHC-34.7 RDW-14.9 Plt Ct-151\n[**2106-11-4**] 06:45AM BLOOD Plt Ct-151\n[**2106-11-4**] 06:45AM BLOOD Glucose-99 UreaN-18 Creat-0.6 Na-133\nK-4.1 Cl-101 HCO3-26 AnGap-10\n[**2106-11-4**] 06:40AM BLOOD Phenyto-8.4*\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nOn [**10-29**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a R Parietal Crani for tumor\nresection. During that time he [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a biopsy of his LUL by\nThoracics. He tolerated both procedures well and was trasferred\nto the floor where he was neurologically stable. He did have LUE\nataxia and alt. proprioception which was at his baseline during\nthat time.\n\nHe did have confusion during the night on a couple of occasions\nand on [**11-1**] had a fall and hit head. There was a sm. amount of\nnew blood on CT however pt was neurologically stable. Subsequent\nCTs revealed no evidence of hematoma expansion.  His neurologic\nstatus continued to improve.  By POD2, he was consistently\ncoherent and without episodes of confusion.\n\nRoutine post-op serum electrolyte check revealed that he was\nhyponatremic (Na 132) and was started on fluid restriction and\nsalt tabs. The restriction and salt tab was tapered\nsubsequently.  By the time of discharge, his Na was 133 without\nfluid restriction or salt taps.\n\nThe patient has a history of Prostatic Hypertrophy and had\nvoiding difficulties post-op.  The urology service was called\nand a foley was placed.  Per urology recommendation, the patient\nwill go home with the Foley and a leg bag.  He will follow up\nwith the urology service after discharge.\n\nThe patient took in adequate POs and he worked well with PT/OT\nand was cleared for home with PT services.  His left hand\ncoordination had significantly improved by the time of\ndischarge.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nFlomax\nLisinopril\nSimvastatin\nASA\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
