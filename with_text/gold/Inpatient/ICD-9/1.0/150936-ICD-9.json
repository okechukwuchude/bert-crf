At rest he did not have any symptoms, but\nyesterday his headaches were significantly more pronounced and\nhe had nausea/vomiting.  He went to an outside hospital where a\nhead CT revealed an approximately 4 x 5 cm left cerebellar mass\nwith resulting effacement of the fourth ventricle and\nenlargement of lateral and third ventricles.  He was transferred\nto [**Hospital1 18**] for higher level of care.\n\nPast Medical History:\nRemote Asthma; since resolved\n\nSocial History:\nlives at home with family; he denies tobacco use, and admits to\nEtOH use approximately once per month\n\nFamily History:\nNon-contributory\n\nPhysical Exam:\nOn Admission:\nO: T:98.1  BP: 144/89     HR:82    R  16     O2Sats 100%RA\nGen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD.\nHEENT: Pupils: [**3-28**] bilaterally        EOMs intact\nNeck: Supple.\nLungs: CTA bilaterally.\nCardiac: RRR.

Differential diagnostic considerations include\nhemangioblastoma, hemorrhagic ependymoma or a vascular lesion\nlikely\ncavernoma. An angiogram can be performed to assess the\nvascularity of this\nlesion.\n\nHead CT [**11-9**]:\nNON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There has been no interval change in the\nsize and mass effect of the complex, multilocular and\nhemorrhagic left cerebellar\nhemispheric mass measuring 3.5 (AP) x 5.1 cm (TRV). The mass\ncontains\nmultiple foci of calcification. No definite new focus of\nbleeding is noted.\nThe degree of mass effect and effacement of the 4th ventricle,\nas well as the secondary hydrocephalus is unchanged, and there\nis no transependymal\nmigration of CSF.\n\nHead CTA [**11-10**]:\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Left cerebellar mass, unchanged.\n2. Lateral ventricles appear slightly smaller than on prior scan\nindicating\nworking ventriculostomy.\n3. No evidence of high flow feeding vessel to the mass, but\nthere is a\npossibility that the mass effect of the hematomas are\ncompressing these\nvessels. There is prominence of the right PICA. These findings\ntogether are\nsuspicious and merit investigation with catheter angiogram.\n\nMRI Spectroscopy Head [**11-10**]:\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Centrally enhancing large 5.0 cm left cerebellar mass. The\nspectroscopy\nfailed due to susceptibility artifact from hemorrhage within the\nlesion. While there is no increased flow on perfusion imaging,\nthis may be due to tamponade effect of the hemorrhagic\ncomponents. Recommend conventional catheter angiography to rule\nout a high flow lesion prior to surgery.\n2. Interval placement of right ventriculostomy tube.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n25M admitted with large L cerebellar mass with obstructive\nhydrocephalus. On [**11-9**] he had a third ventriculostomy which was\ndone without difficulty. Pt was monitored in the PACU overnight\nand transferred to step down for observation. Neurologically the\npatient was stable and does not have any deficits. Currently he\nis neurologically intact and safe fdor discharge. Will return\nfor surgical resection.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nNone\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
