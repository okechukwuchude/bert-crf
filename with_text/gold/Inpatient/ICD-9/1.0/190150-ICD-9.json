However, during the\nadmission, we also found a 5-mm aneurysm involving the\nright supraclinoid area measuring 3.7 x 6.2 mm.  This is in the\nsuperior hypophyseal area.  I had offered her the option of\nconservative management given her age of 69 years, but she is\nbeing distraught with the fear that this could rupture despite\nthe fact that I had discussed with her that the risk of rupture\nis only approximately 2% per year.

IV\n sedation was given.  Anesthesia was induced in the supine position.  Both\n groins were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Access was gained to the\n right common femoral artery using a Seldinger technique and a 6 French\n vascular sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery.  I now\n catheterized the right internal carotid artery with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2155**] 2 catheter and\n this was exchanged out and a Neuron 6 French catheter was placed in the right\n internal carotid artery.  5000 units of heparin was given to anticoagulate the\n patient.  Following this, we proceeded to catheterize the right middle\n cerebral artery with XT-27 microcatheter along with a Synchro wire.  Following\n this, through a second port, the aneurysm was catheterized with an SL-10\n microcatheter.  We now deployed a 4 x 4.5 x 20 mm Neuroform stent across the\n neck of the aneurysm.  Following this, the aneurysm was coiled with a 3-mm\n Target UltraSoft coil and with 2-mm Target UltraSoft coil.  Following this,\n the aneurysm was seen to be fairly obliterated except for a small residual at\n the base.  The catheters were now removed and right common femoral artery\n arteriogram was done and a 6 French Angio-Seal was used for closure of the\n right common femoral artery puncture site.\n\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2175-4-12**] 4:05 PM\n CAROT/CEREB [**Hospital1 **]                                                  Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 24720**]\n Reason: coiling of anuerysmAnesthesia has been booked for [**4-12**] at 1pm\n  Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 100ML OPTI240; 66MM OPTI320\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n FINDINGS:  Right internal carotid artery arteriogram shows 5 x 3 mm aneurysm\n of the right superior hypophyseal artery with a broad neck.\n\n Right internal carotid artery arteriogram status post coil embolization shows\n no evidence of stenosis at the placement of the stent and the aneurysm itself\n is obliterated except for a small residual at the base.\n\n Right common femoral artery arteriogram shows widely patent right common\n femoral artery.\n\n IMPRESSION: [**Known firstname 1100**] [**Known lastname **] underwent cerebral angiography and stent-assisted\n coil embolization of a brain aneurysm in the right paraclinoid area without\n any complications.
