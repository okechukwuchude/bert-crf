Application of allograft for fusion augmentation.\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\nHPI: 55 yo F who fell backwards off of a [**Location (un) 453**] balcony onto\na\nconcrete slab. Pt was leaning backwards on a rail at a\nrestaurant\nwhen the rail gave way and she fell approximately 7 feet onto a\nconcrete slab. Pt recalls the entirety of the event and denies\nLOC. She does recall striking the back of her head on the\nconcrete. She describes immediate pain in the middle of her back\nafter the fall and was unable to stand because of it. She denies\nany numbness or tingling in her extremities and denies any\nincontinence following her fall. Pt was taken to an OSH where\nshe\nwas found to have multiple posterior rib fxs (6th-8th on L, 9th\non R), a T10 compression fx w/ impringement on the thecal sac.\nPt\nwas subsequently transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evlauation\nand Spine surgery consultation.\nOn presentation to the [**Name (NI) **], pt was stable and complaining of\nsevere pain throughout her mid back. While in the trauma bay her\nO2 saturation decreased to high 80s on NC and a nonrebreather\nwas\nrequired. At that point she was tachypnic into the 30s. She was\nadmitted to the TSICU for close observation, respiratory\nsupport,\nand pain control. Ortho Spine was consulted for further\nevaluation of her spinal fractures\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nPast Medical History: anxiety - gerd\n\n\nSocial History:\nSocial History: Denies Alcohol and Smoking\n\n\nFamily History:\nNC\n\nPhysical Exam:\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION upon admission:  [**2157-12-16**]\n\n Temp:afeb HR:100 BP:131/83 Resp:36 O(2)Sat:99 Normal\n\nConstitutional: Immob\nHEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic, Pupils equal, round and\nreactive to light, Extraocular muscles intact\nOropharynx within normal limits\nChest: Clear to auscultation\nCardiovascular: Regular Rate and Rhythm, Normal first and\nsecond heart sounds\nAbdominal: Soft, Nontender, Nondistended\nGU/Flank: No costovertebral angle tenderness\nExtr/Back: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema\nSkin: No rash, Warm and dry\nNeuro: Speech fluent; no deficits\nPsych: Normal mood, Normal mentation\nHeme/[**Last Name (un) **]/[**Last Name (un) **]: No petechiae\n\n\nPertinent Results:\n[**2157-12-16**]:  Cat scan of spine:\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Burst fracture of T10 vertebral body, with outward\ndisplacement of\nmultiple fracture fragments with associated laminar fractures on\nboth sides of the posterior arch of T10. Bone along the\nposterior margin of T10 vertebral body is displaced into the\nspinal canal.\n\n2. Compression of the superior endplate of the T7 vertebral body\nwith intact posterior arch point.\n\n3. Transverse fractures of left T7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.\n\n4. Fractures of the left 5th, 6th and 7th ribs and right 9th\nposterior ribs.\n\n5. Developing atelectasis in bilateral lungs as well as possible\nbilateral\npleural effusions\n\n[**2157-12-15**]:  Cat scan of abdomen and pelvis:\n\n IMPRESSION:\n1. Bilateral dependent pleural effusion with some hyperdensity\nwithin the\npleural effusion which may represent a component of hemothorax.\n\n2. Adjacent compressive atelectasis.\n\n3. Bilateral rib fractures as detailed above.\n\n4. Fractures of the left 7, 8, 9, 10,11 transverse processes.\n\n5. Burst fracture of T10 vertebral body with posterior arch\ninvolvement and\nretropulsion of the components of the fracture fragment into the\nvertebral\ncanal.\n\n6. Fracture of the anterior superior endplate of T7 with no\nobvious arch\ninvolvement\n\n[**2157-12-15**]:  Chest x-ray:\n\nPORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: In the interim since the most\nrecent chest\nradiograph there is increased inflation of the left lung.\nBilateral pleural effusions are still noted, left greater than\nright. Rib fractures are better visualized on the adjacent chest\nCT. Cardiac silhouette is top normal.\n\n[**2157-12-16**]:  MR thoracic spine:\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\n1. Worst fracture of T10 vertebra with retropulsion and likely\ndisruption of the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments\nwith retropulsion causing mild spinal stenosis.\n\n2. Moderate compression of T7 vertebra with probable disruption\nof the\nposterior longitudinal ligament and mild retropulsion in the mid\nportion in contact with the anterior aspect of the spinal cord.\n\n3. Disc herniation at T3-4 level indenting the anterior aspect\nof the spinal cord with subtle increased signal in the T4\nvertebra, likely due to mild compression injury. Alternatively,\nthe increased signal in the T4 vertebra could be due to\ndegenerative change.\n\n4. No evidence of high-grade spinal cord compression or\nintrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities\n\n[**2157-12-17**]:  cat scan of the head:\n\nIMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process\n\n[**2157-12-17**]:  Chest x-ray:\n\nFINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-16**], there is some\nincreased\nopacification at the right base consistent with atelectasis and\nfluid in the pleural space. Retrocardiac atelectasis is again\nseen. The multiple rib fractures are better visualized on the CT\nscan. Top normal or slightly\nenlarged cardiac silhouette is again noted. No definite\npulmonary vascular congestion\n\n[**2157-12-18**]:  T-spine:\n\n FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION: AP and lateral intraoperative images\nof the\nthoracolumbar spine. At approximately T10, a compression\nfracture is noted.

Initially, she\nwas seen at an outside hospital where she was reported to have\nmultiple rib fractures and a thoracic compression fracture.\n  Upon admission to the Acute Care Service, she was evaluated by\nOrtho-spine who recommended TLSO brace. She had blood work done\nand further imaging of her back, chest, and head.\n  She had an episode of oxygen desaturation upon admission, and\nfor this reason was admitted to the Trauma Intensive Care unit\nfor neuro-checks, pulmonary toilet and pain management. She was\nplaced on log-roll precautions until she was fitted for her TLSO\nbrace.\n  She was taken to the Operating room on [**12-18**] where she had a\nT10 posterior corpectomy and a T9-T11 fusion.  During her\noperative procedure, she did receive  blood for a liter blood\nloss. She was extubated in the recovery room.\n  Her post-operative course has been stable. She is afebrile and\nher vital signs are stable.  She is tolerating a regular diet.\nShe has been out of bed with the TLSO brace.  Her pain is\ncontrolled with oxycodone. She was evaluated by Physical Therapy\nService and rehab was recommended with the hopes of improving\nher mobility and returning home.\n  After an uneventful post op course she was discharged to rehab\non [**2157-12-21**] and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**] in 2 weeks.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications: Omeprazole\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\n2. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a\nday) as needed for constipation.\n3. bisacodyl 5 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)

L transverse fx T7-11\n6. acute blood loss anemai\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent\n\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive\nActivity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or\nwheelchair, pt has TLSO brace when out of bed\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nYou are being discharged after you were admitted for a fall in\nwhich you sustained back and rib fractures.  You were taken to\nthe operating room for a laminectomy and fusion.  You are now\npreparing for discharge with the following instructions:\n\n  Your injury caused posterior right and left rib fractures\nwhich can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take\nshallow breaths because of the pain.\n\n*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay\nahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep\nbreaths. If the pain medication is too sedating take half the\ndose and notify your physician.\n\n*  Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to\ndecrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4\ntimes every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small\nairways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that\npool in the lungs.\n\n*  You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to\nhold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing\nand deep breathing.\n\n*  Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short\nperiods may ease the pain.\n\n*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you\nshould take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid\nand fiber intake if possible.\n\n*  Do NOT smoke\n\n*  If your doctor allows, non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs\nare very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin,\nAdvil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side\neffects so make sure your doctor approves.\n\n*  Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute\nshortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation\naround your ribs ( crepitus )\n\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nPlease follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**] in 2 weeks. You can schedule\nthis appointment by calling #[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1228**].\n\nPlease follow up with the Acute Care Service in 2 weeks, you can\nschedule this appointment by calling #[**Telephone/Fax (1) 600**]\n\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2157-12-21**]"
