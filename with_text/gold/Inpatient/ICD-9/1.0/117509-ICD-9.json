On admission to the CCU,\n   pacer dependent at a rate of 80bpm.\n   .\n   TELEMETRY:  pacer dependent at a rate 80bpm.\n   .\n   ECHO:   [**1-15**] The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall\n   thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal\n   (LVEF >55%) Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are\n   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with\n   good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic regurgitation\n   is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial\n   mitral regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic\n   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for\n   review) of [**2097-7-18**], there is no signficant change\n   .\n   Exercise Echo stress test:  [**2101-11-18**]  The patient exercised for 9\n   minutes and 00 seconds according to a Modified [**Doctor Last Name 10270**] treadmill\n   protocol (3.5 METS) reaching a peak heart rate of 117 bpm and a peak\n   blood pressure of 190/82 mmHg. The test was stopped because of fatigue.\n   This level of exercise represents a fair exercise tolerance for age. In\n   response to stress, the ECG showed no ST-T wave changes (see exercise\n   report for details). There is resting hypertension with There were\n   normal blood pressure response and a slightly blunted heart rate\n   response to stress.  Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 86\n   bpm and a blood pressure of 152/84 mmHg. These demonstrated normal\n   regional and global left ventricular systolic function. Right\n   ventricular free wall motion is normal. Doppler demonstrated no aortic\n   stenosis, aortic regurgitation or significant mitral regurgitation or\n   resting LVOT gradient.  Echo images were acquired within 33 seconds\n   after peak stress at heart rates of 110 - 87 bpm. These demonstrated\n   appropriate augmentation of all left ventricular segments with slight\n   decrease in cavity size. There was augmentation of right ventricular\n   free wall motion.\n   IMPRESSION: Fair functional exercise capacity. No ECG or 2D\n   echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to achieved workload.\n   Resting hypertension with normal hemodynamic response to exercise.\n   .\n   ETT:  [**2101-11-18**] This 82 yo man was referred to the lab for evaluation of\n   worsening dypsnea on exertion. The patient completed 9 minutes on a\n   modified [**Doctor Last Name 10270**] protocol and was stopped at his request due to fatigue\n   and shortness of breath (~3.5 METS). This represents a fair exercise\n   capacity for his age. The patient denied any chest, back, arm, or neck\n   discomforts throughout the study. No significant ST segment changes\n   were noted during exercise or in recovery. The rhythm was sinus with\n   one VPB in recovery. Resting hypertension (152/84) with an appropriate\n   blood pressure response to exercise.\n     IMPRESSION: No ischemic EKG changes or anginal symptoms. Echo report\n   sent separately.\n   .  [image002.jpg]\n   Assessment and Plan\n   83 yo male with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and\n   bifascicular block presents with syncope secondary to third degree\n   heart block.\n   .\n   # RHYTHM:  The patient was in third degree heart block on presentation,\n   temporary pacer wire placed in the ED, capturing well at a rate of\n   80bpm, Vamp 5 and sensitivity 2.0.  Will continue to monitor and\n   maintain current settings.  The patient has significant risk factors\n   for coronary artery disease, and was not on any nodal agents per DC\n   summary in [**5-16**], thus ischemia is a possible cause of his conduction\n   disorder.  Will attempt to obtain more information regarding home\n   medications in AM.  The patient had a left anterior fascicular block\n   and right bundle branch block present at baseline in [**Month (only) 807**] of this year,\n   thus it is possible that the loss of his posterior fascicle may be the\n   cause of his block.  However, this may also be generalized AV nodal\n   dysfunction.\n   - Temp pacer wire, PPM in AM\n   - Cycle cardiac enzymes\n   - Avoid nodal agents\n   - Atropine at the bedside\n   - Follow EP recs\n   .\n   # CORONARIES:  No history of coronary artery disease, but significant\n   risk factors of hyperlipidemia and hypertension, not treated\n   previously.  The patient had a normal stress echocardiogram in [**Month (only) **] of\n   [**2100**].  Will cycle cardiac enzymes to evaluate for ischemia as cause of\n   heart block, although first set negative.  The patient may need a\n   cardiac catherization to evaluate for reversible cause of heart block.\n   - Cycle enzymes\n   - Continue aspirin 325mg\n   - Consider statin therapy after lipid panel in AM\n   - TTE in AM to eval for wall motion abnormalities\n   .\n   # PUMP:  The patient had an echo in [**2101-1-7**] which did not show\n   evidence of systolic dysfunction, EF > 55%, regional wall motion\n   abnormalities or significant valvular disease.  Given risk of possible\n   ischemia, would consider echo in AM to evaluate for change in systolic\n   function or wall motion abnormalities.\n   - Monitor I/Os and daily weights\n   - Maintain even fluid balance\n   - TTE as above\n   .\n   # History of Alcohol Abuse: CIWA scale with ativan as needed if the\n   patient starts to demonstrate signs of withdrawal including agitation\n   and hypertension.\n   .\n   # History of Diverticulitis:  S/P Hemicolectomy.

On\nadmission to the CCU, pacer dependent at a rate of 80bpm.\nECG:\nHigh degree A-V block. Again, given the inconsistent\nrelationship between\nP waves and QRS complexes tracing is suggestive of complete\nheart block with ventricular or aberrantly conducted nodal\nescape rhythm. There is also a rightward axis deviation. Right\nbundle-branch block and non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.\nCompared to the previous tracing #2 evidence for complete heart\nblock is more clearly seen.\n\nTTE [**2102-10-3**]:\nThe left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses\nand cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality,\na focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.\nOverall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF\n60-70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are\nnormal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.\nThe aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic\nstenosis is not present. The aortic valve is not well seen. No\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are\nmildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial\nmitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery\nsystolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic\npericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of\ntamponade.\n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2101-2-3**], no\nmajor change is evident.\n\nCXR:\nFINDINGS: Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker has been inserted,\nwith leads\nintact and in standard positions, ending in the right atrium and\nright\nventricle. There is no pneumothorax, focal consolidation,\npleural effusion or pulmonary edema. Degenerative changes are\nnoted in the thoracic spine.\n\nIMPRESSION: New left-sided pacemaker with leads in standard\npositions without evidence of pneumothorax.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n# Complete Heart Block: The patient had a know history of RBBB\nand LAFB. His current presentation was likely degenerative\nconduction disease, finally losing his posterior fasicle. He had\nno evidence of active ischemia. A TTE showed no focal wall\nmotion abnormalities, cardiac biomarkers were flat, and ECGs\nshowed no signs of ischemia.  He was initially emergently\nintubated and tranvenously paced. He rapidly extubated and\neventually had a PPM placed with little complication. He\ntolerated the procedure well and was discharged home on PO\nclindamycin. He will follow up with EP and the device clinic. He\nwas started on 81mg of aspirin for primary prevention.\n\n#HTN: Not previously on medical management and remained\nnormotensive in house. No medications started.\n\n#Hyperlipidemia: Lipid profile at goal when checked in house. No\nmedications started.\n\n#Prophylaxis: HSC\n\n#Code: Full confirmed\n\nCOMM: [**Name (NI) 1404**] [**Name (NI) 14**] (Wife) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1405**]\n\nMedications on Admission:\nAspirin 81mg QAM\nPregabalin 75mg [**Hospital1 **]\nZyrtec 10mg QAM\nOmeprazole 20mg QAM\nColace PRN\nSenna PRN\nTylenol PRN\nPercocet PRN\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

This was treated with a pacemaker that will regulate the\nelectrical system of your heart from now on. You did not have a\nheart attack. Your echocardiogram showed no significant change\nor abnormality. This is a preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] and will be\nreviewed by the attending cardiologist later in the day.\n.\nMedication changes:\n1. Take a baby aspirin 81 mg daily.\n2. Take Clindamycin for 3 days, this is an antibiotic that will\nprevent an infection at the pacer site.\n3. Vicodin: to take for pain at the pacer site or shoulders\n.\nNo lifting more than 5 pounds with your left arm or lifting you\nleft arm over your head for 6 weeks. Keep the dressing dry, no\nshowers or baths for 1 week. Do not change the pacer dressing\nunless it is damp.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nProvider:  [**Name10 (NameIs) 676**] CLINIC Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 62**] Date/Time:[**2102-10-10**]\n2:00.\n[**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Center, [**Location (un) 436**].
