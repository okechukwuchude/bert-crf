Patient was\nfound to have comminuted vertebral fracture at T8 with\nretropulsion of multiple bony fragments into the central spinal\ncanal with cord transection demonstrated.  Neurosurgery was\nconsulted in the trauma unit.  The patient was admitted to the\nTICU and stabilized.  Upon clearance of the C-spine the patients\nc-collar was removed.  The patient was then transfered to the\nfloor and on [**9-2**] the patient was taken to the operating room\nwith Neurosurgery for repair of his injuries and was transfered\nto the Neurosurgery service for continued care.He underwent\nposterior instrumented fusion T5-11 with repair of dura, right\niliac crest bone harvest and placement of lumbar drain all done\nunder general anesthesia. There was estimated 1 liter of blood\nloss during the procedure and the patient recieved 2 units of\npacked red blood cells in the OR. He tolerated this proceure\nwell, was extubated in TICU.  Lumbar drain was functioning and\ndrained 5-10cc/hr.  Diet was advanced, medication changed to PO.\nHe was transferred to the floor on [**9-3**].  His activity was\nadvanced with help of PT and [**Doctor Last Name 2598**] lift, he tolerated being\nupright.  The patient had fevers beginning on [**9-3**] and again on\n[**9-6**] with workup all being negative(CXR, cultures,abdominal\nUS,LENIs) though this was during time he was being covered with\nancef while lumbar drain was in place. The lumbar drain was\nclamped on [**9-7**].  Lumbar drain was removed [**9-8**] with wound being\ndry.  Good placement of operative hardware noted on thoracic\nXray. ID consult was obtained but pt remained afebrile after\nlumbar drain removed and ancef stopped.  He was also begun on\nbowel regimen and remained with foley.   Urine cultures showed\nno growth.  Blood and CSF cultures were all negative.Wound was\nclean and dry. He required enemas and suppositories for bowels,\nhad foley for bladder. On [**9-9**], the patient developed right\nwrist pain.  The wrist xray was negative for fracture. He\nexperienced reported chest pain and his EKG was negative. His\nabdomen was distended and a KUB xray was performed which showed\nno ileus or obstruction or fecal impaction. [**9-10**] stool was sent\nfor C-Diff which was negative. The patient continues to be seen\nby Rehab medicine during his hospital stay.\nOn [**9-17**] he had some mild dehiscence of the upper 1/3rd of his\nincision. There was scant drainage. Wound care consult was\nrequested. The wound adequately healed in time. On [**9-18**] he was\ninstructed how to straight cath himself. On [**9-19**] he was found to\nhave mild diabetes, diet controlled and also started on emycin\nfor conjuctivitis. On [**9-24**] he received wrist brace for transfer.\nOn [**2189-10-19**] he was found to have foul smelling urine with\nnegative urinalysis but culture showing MSSA and he was started\non 7d course of cipro on [**2189-10-22**].\n\nWeekly case management meetings have been taking place with the\npatient, his pastor, friends, the neurosurgery team, case\nmanagement, Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and nursing throughout his prolonged\nhospital stay. The meetings have explored all options of rehab\n(he is unable to go to due to no insurance), medical shelters\n(denied due to no longer follow term care), going back to [**Country 4194**]\nand apartments in the local area. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] has set up free care\nat [**Hospital6 **] with a spinal cord specialist. Free\nmedications have been set up through our free care pharmacy. A\nreconditioned wheelchair was obtain, a commode and a slider\nboard, and cath equipment were all given to the patient. The\npatient is now proficient in self cath and bowel care. His PPD\nwas read as negative for tuberculosis. He was discharged to\napartment with community support on [**2189-10-23**].\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nNone\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
