The patient\ntolerated the procedure well. He was subsequently admitted to\nthe plastic surgery service. Over the ensuing week his fingers\nremained perfused. However, on [**12-13**] the tone on the index finger\nwaxed and waned eventually losing digital pulse and no bleeding\nwith pin prick. On [**2163-12-15**], the patient was taken back to the\nOR for revision amputation of the index finger. The patient\ntolerated the procedure well.\n\nNeuro: Post-operatively, the patient received Dilaudid IV/PCA\nwith good effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral\nintake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.\n\nCV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;\nvital signs were routinely monitored. Leeching therapy was\ninstituted to maintain perfusion to the severed digits. The\npatient was weaned off leeching therapy prior to discharge.\n\nPulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint;\nvital signs were routinely monitored.\n\nGI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until\ntolerating oral intake.

The\npatient's temperature was closely watched for signs of\ninfection.\n\nProphylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during\nthis stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as\npossible. The patient was also maintained on aspirin therapy to\nmaximize perfusion to the reimplantation site.\n\nAt the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile\nwith stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating,\nvoiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nNone\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
