The patient\nwas in his usual state of health until [**2175-12-28**] when he was in a\nminor car accident after making a wrong turn on a familiar\nstreet, hitting a post from the R side. He was not injured in\nthe\nfender-bender. The next day, he was forgetful and left his car\ndoor open when at work. On Saturday [**12-30**], he stated to his wife\nthat he felt \"muttled\", but did not complain of any specific\ndeficits nor did his wife note any. However, the next day his\ndaughter reported that he mixed up words when speaking with her.\nOn Monday ([**1-1**]), he could not remember his address when asked\nby\nthe auto-mechanic. He was able to go to work at court, but was\nworried when he could not figure out how to sign his name.\nSpecifically, he had difficulty writing letters and was\nperseverative. Though he knew what he wanted to write, he was\nnot\nable to do so correctly. This event prompted him to consult his\nPCP who discovered [**Name Initial (PRE) **] small right peripheral visual field deficit\nwhich Mr. [**Name (NI) 21862**] wife states was \"about 10% of his vision\".\nHe\nhad never had this before. He had no headache. His doctor\nrequested a head CT which he had on [**1-3**]. The CT scan revealed a\nleft parietal/occipital mass. The next day, his symptoms\npersisted and he was admitted to this hospital.\n\nPer his wife, in the days leading up to admission, Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 4027**]\ndid not have any fever, cough, weight changes, nausea, vomiting,\nor diarrhea, or other signs of infection. He did not complain of\nnumbness, weakness, tingling, or hearing changes. No recent\ntravel or tick exposure. Most recent immunization was Influenza\nvaccine in [**2175-9-20**], which he had received in prior years\nwithout problems. [**Name (NI) **] prior such episodes.\n\nOn admission, his R visual field cut was noted to be more\npronounced. Over the next couple of days([**Date range (1) 61317**])), he had\ndecreased speech production, decreased attention, and decreased\norientation to his surroundings. He could not remember how to\nuse\nthe phone. Because of his clinical deterioration and concern for\nhigh-grade glioma, on [**1-8**], he had a stereotactic brain biopsy\nof\nthe left occipital/parietal mass. He was intubated and sedated\nuntil the morning of [**1-9**]. During the night he was noted to not\nbe moving his RUE as much as the left, stat head CT was\nunchanged. He was extubated and given Haldol 2.5mg for\naggitation\nat 9:30am (1.5 hours before exam). He has been on broad-spectrum\nempiric Abx (Vanc/gent/Levoflox) given concern for abscess\nthough\nprelim path gram stain was sterile. He has also been placed on\nempiric Keppra prophylaxis though no clinical episodes\nconcerning\nfor seizure.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\n1. DM2 with poor control and peripheral neuropathy\n2.

lesion with inhomogeneous peripheral\nenhancement,\nsurrounding edema, and strikingly slow diffusion in portions of\nthe periphery.\nAlthough a malignant neoplasm must be considered, the properties\nof the\nmargin, including the diffusion characteristics, raise the\npossibility of an\ninflammatory or demyelinating process as discussed above.\n\nCT Abd, pelvis [**2176-1-5**]:\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Large left retroperitoneal soft tissue mass as well as large\nretroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Primary diagnostic\nconsiderations include\nparaganglioma, extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma and metastatic\ndisease.\n2: Cholelithiasis.\n\nCT Chest: [**2176-1-5**]:\nAirways are patent to the subsegmental levels bilaterally. Lung\nvolumes are\nlow bilaterally. Bibasilar dependent atelectasis is visualized.\nNo focal\npulmonary nodule or mass is visualized. There is no axillary or\nmediastinal\nlymphadenopathy. Atherosclerotic calcification is visualized of\nthe coronary\narteries as well as of the aorta. The heart and great vessels\nare otherwise\nunremarkable. Note is made of a large amount of mediastinal fat.\nA large right\npretracheal node measures 13x12 mm (3:14). A large right\nepicardiac node\nmeasures 13x9 mm\n\nBrain mass pathology:\n1.  \"Left occipital lobe tumor #1\" (A - B):\n\nDemyelinated white matter with extensive macrophage and\nperivascular lymphocytic infiltrates (see note).\n\n\n\n2.  \"Left occipital lobe tumor #2\" (C - D):\n\nDemyelinated white matter with extensive macrophage and\nperivascular lymphocytic infiltrates (see note).\n\n\n\n3.  \"Left deep occipital tumor\" (E - F):\n\nDemyelinated white matter with extensive macrophage and\nperivascular lymphocytic infiltrates (see note).\n\n\n\n4.  \"Left occipital lobe tumor\" (G):\n\nLeptomeninges and gliotic white matter.\n\n\n\nNote:  By immunohistochemistry (blocks A-D), the majority of the\nlymphocytes are CD-3 and CD-8 positive cytotoxic cells.  A\nsmaller subset stains positive for CD4.  Only rare scattered\nB-lymphocytes are present, marking with CD20.  CD68 highlights\nthe diffuse infiltrates of macrophages within the white matter.\nPolyoma virus ([**Male First Name (un) 2326**] and SV40), EBV latent membrane protein (LMP),\nand CMV immunostains are negative. .   Special stains were\nperformed on blocks A-D. Luxol fast blue (LFB) shows a near\ncomplete loss of myelin staining in the white matter, with\nscattered staining present within macrophages.  No hemosiderin\ndeposition is seen on iron stain arguing against a chronic\nvasculitis.   Bodian stain reveals areas within the white matter\nshowing preserved demyelinated axons. In other white matter\nareas there is axon loss.\n\n\n\nThe findings supportive of an acute and chronic primary\ndemyelinating disorder (e.g., multiple sclerosis).\n\n\n\nClinical: Specimen submitted: 1.

The specimen is entirely submitted as follows: C =\nfrozen section remnant, D = all remaining tissue.\n\n\n\nPart 3 is submitted for intraoperative consultation additionally\nlabeled \"left deep occipital tumor #3\". It consists of multiple\ntan-pink soft tissue fragments that measure 0.8 x 0.7 x  0.3 cm\nin aggregate. 50% of the specimen was used for smear and frozen\nsection. The frozen section and smear diagnosis by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4223**] is: \"[**Doctor Last Name **] matter and necrotic white matter. Smear\ncontains some calcified and fibrotic material (? abscess wall)\".\nThe specimen is then entirely submitted as follows: E = frozen\nsection remnant, F = all remaining tissue.\n\n\n\nPart 4 is additionally labeled \"left occipital lobe tumor\". It\nconsists of multiple tan-pink fragments that measure 0.5 x 0.2 x\n0.1 cm in aggregate. The specimen is entirely submitted in\ncassette G.\n\nMRI brain [**2176-1-9**]:\n1. Allowing for post-biopsy changes, the left parietal lesion\nappears similar\nto [**2176-1-4**]. Pathology is pending.\n\n2. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.\n\n3. Normal head MRA.\n\nEEG [**2176-1-10**]:\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and\ndisorganized\nbackground, bursts of generalized slowing, and additional focal\ndelta\nslowing in the left posterior quadrant. The first two\nabnormalities\nsignify a widespread encephalopathy. Medications, metabollic\ndisturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.\nThe\nadditional focal slowing indicates subcortical dysfunction in\nthe left\nposterior quadrant, likely related to the reported mass. There\nwere no\nclearly epileptiform features.\n\nretroperitoneal mass needle biopsy:\nDIAGNOSIS:\nLeft retroperitoneal mass, core biopsy:\n\n     1. Fibrous tissue with lymphoplasmacytic inflammation; see\nhemepath note.\n\n     2.  Refer to separate cytology report (C09-3221) for\nadditional information.\n\nHemepath note (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]):\n\n     H&E sections show small, tight clusters of CD20-positive\nB-cells, with a small population of scattered CD3-positive\nT-cells. Although a  reactive process is favored, a low-grade\nB-cell lymphoma cannot be ruled out.\n\nClinical: Rest of retroperitoneal mass. 58 year old male found\nto have large left retroperitoneal mass with lymphadenopathy.\nGross:  The specimen is received in a formalin-filled container\nlabeled with the patient's name \"[**Last Name (LF) 4027**], [**Known firstname **] F\" and the\nmedical record number and consists of multiple fragments of core\nbiopsy and tissue measuring up to 1.0 cm in length. The specimen\nis strained through a biopsy bag and submitted entirely in A.\n\nRetroperitoneal mass, needle biopsy touch-prep:\nSUSPICIOUS for malignancy.\n\n  A few clusters of highly atypical cells have large nuclei\n  and prominent nucleoli. The cytoplasm is stripped and\n  further classification is not possible\n\nScrotal US [**2176-1-23**]\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No testicular mass. Normal epididymis.\n2. Diffusely heterogeneous left testis, without enlargement.\nThis appearance\nlikely reflects prior injury such as remote trauma or orchitis\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThis 58 yo man was admitted with confusion and right visual\nfield loss as outlined in the HPI. His brain MRI showed a large\nleft posterior lesion, suspicious for tumor. Since this may have\nbeen a met, a CT torso was pursued, which showed a large\nretroperitoneal mass with enlarged lymph nodes. He underwent an\nopen biopsy of his brain lesion, and the intraop pathology\nsuggested there were no tumor cells and this was a demyelinating\nlesion. He was placed on a 5-day course of IV solumedrol\nfollowed by a slow prednisone taper from 60 mg to off over ~ 2\nweeks. He has improvement, but not complete resolution of his\nvisual field loss and confusion. He also sustained some right\nweakness, particularly in the delt post brain surgery, however\nthis improved to nearly full strength over days. He next\nreceived an IR-guided needle bx of his retroperitoneal mass. The\ntouch-prep of this was suspicious for malignant cells, however\nthe core histology just showed an inflammatory process. Because\nof this disparity, he underwent a laproscopic biopsy of his\nretroperitoneal mass. The preliminary results of this suggested\na cancer. The final pathology is still pending, but the\npathologists were able to tell us that it was not a cancer that\nrequired immediate treatment. He received an oncology consult,\nand will be followed in the oncology clinic. During the duration\nof his admission, he was followed closely by the [**Last Name (un) **] team.\nThey changed his regimen to Humalog 75/25 90/50/50 TID QAC. His\nneurological exam on DC was significant for ongoing deficits in\nattention and memory and a right inferior quadrantanopsia.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1. Plavix\n2.
