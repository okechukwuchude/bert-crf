Dyspnea\n   Etiology of his dyspnea is likely multifactorial. Differential\n   diagnosis includes pneumonia, aspiration, hypoventilation related to\n   increased ascites, and effusion. Regarding pneumonia, CXR infiltrate\n   and leukocytosis are suggestive. Regarding hypoventilation, patient may\n   have increased sensation of dyspnea related to his ascites. Regarding\n   effusion, patient has evidence of effusion on CXR. Etiology of his\n   effusion could be secondary to pneumonia or malignancy.\n   - treat for hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn\n   - consider IR-guided paracentesis for evaluation of paracentesis\n   - consider IR guided thoracentesis for evaluation of his pleural\n   effusion if his symptoms do not improve with antibiotics\n   .\n   2. Hyponatremia\n   Patient has profound hyponatremia. Patient appears total body\n   overloaded on exam, although he is likely intravascularly depleted.\n   This appears likely given his concentrated urine, although it is\n   somewhat surprising that his creatinine is normal. His hyponatremia is\n   likely related to an increased ADH related to intravascular volume\n   depletion. An additional possibility includes SIADH secondary to a\n   pulmonary process. Given his altered mental status and sodium values,\n   he likely has symptomatic hyponatremia. Will likely need aggressive\n   repletion of sodium with increase in sodium concentration of\n   1-2mEq/hour for the first 3-4 hours and then can slow down to\n   .5-1mEq/hour after that.\n   - start hypertonic saline at 150mL/hour x 3 hours and check sodium and\n   make appropriate adjustments after that\n   - add on urine and serum osm\n   .\n   3. Leukocytosis\n   Etiology of his leukocytosis is unclear. Differential diagnosis\n   includes most likely infection, with pneumonia being his most likely\n   source.\n   - follow-up blood cultures\n   - send urine cultures\n   - follow-up final read of CXR\n   - send sputum gram stain and culture\n   - continue vancomycin and zosyn for treatment of presumed hospital\n   acquired pneumonia\n   .\n   4. Guaiac positive stools\n   Patient was found to have guiac positive stools, likely related to his\n   history of GI cancer and it is unclear if he has any GI tract\n   involvement of his cancer. In light of guiac positive stools, will hold\n   off on any anticoagulation at this time.\n   .\n   5. Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer\n   Patient has known metastatic pancreatic cancer. He has been offered\n   palliative chemotherapy and radiation treatment, which he has refused.\n   He has also had palliative care evaluation which has not been pursued.\n   Patient's CT scan demonstrates progression of his disease with new\n   ascites, likely related to his increased burden of hepatic  mets.\n   - will let patient's primary oncologist know that patient is\n   hospitalized\n   - palliative care consult\n   6. Ascites\n   Patient has developed new ascites which is likely related  to his\n   increased metastatic disease. IR guided paracentesis may improve his\n   subjective symptoms of dyspnea, although this will likely recur quickly\n   given his metastatic disease.\n   - consider IR guided paracentesis pending improvement in sodium\n   7. Splenic Vein Thrombosis\n   Patient has newly diagnosed splenic vein thrombosis. Unclear if this\n   represents a spontaneous thrombosis or is related to tumor invasion.\n   Patient is certainly a poor candidate for anticoagulation given his\n   poor PO intake, multiple comorbidities, and reported allergy to\n   coumadin.\n   - appreciate GI input\n   - continue to monitor\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition:\n   Comments: NPO for now\n   Glycemic Control:\n   Lines:\n   18 Gauge - [**2189-3-30**] 12:54 AM\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT: Boots\n   Stress ulcer:\n   VAP:\n   Comments:\n   Communication:  Comments:\n   Code status: Full code\n   Disposition: ICU\n"

Pt placed on 800cc to 1L fluid restriction with\nimprovement to likely baseline of 126-128.\n.\n# Hypotension: Per Renal, likely new baseline in setting of\nprogressive chronic disease. Ddx hypovolemia given tachycardia\nbut little response to fluid boluses. Initial concern of\nhypoperfusion given elevated lactate but persistence of lactate\nlikely [**12-29**] to malignancy.\n.\n# Dyspnea: Infiltrate on CXR initially treated as HAP with vanco\nand zosyn. Switched to cefpodoxime prior to discharge as MRSA\nscreen negative and pseudomonas unlikely given clinical picture.\nLegionella negative. Rapid respiratory viral Ag test negative.\nPrior to discharge, switched to cefpodoxime as MRSA screen\nnegative and low clinical suspicion for pseudomonas pneumonia.\nPlan to complete 8-day today course of antibiotics, last dose on\n[**2189-4-6**]. Small bilateral effusions on imaging (ddx parapneumonic\nv. malignancy) may also have contributed to dyspnea.\n.\n# Bandemia: Likely [**12-29**] pneumonia, stable to mildly improved. No\nother localizing sx. Urine cultures negative with no growth on\nblood cultures to date. C. diff toxin test ordered but no sample\nsent; unlikely etiology.\n.\n# Guaiac positive stools: Patient was found to have guiac\npositive stools, likely related to his history of GI cancer and\nit is unclear if he has any GI tract involvement of his cancer.\nIn light of guiac positive stools, held off on any\nanticoagulation at this time.\n.\n# Splenic Vein Thrombosis\nPatient has newly diagnosed splenic vein thrombosis. Unclear if\nthis represents a spontaneous thrombosis or is related to tumor\ninvasion. Family made aware of diagnosis, but anticoagulation\nheld as pt is poor candidate given his poor PO intake, multiple\ncomorbidities, and reported allergy to coumadin.\n.\n# Fluid overload: [**Month (only) 116**] be [**12-29**] increased metastatic disease, low\nalbumin. [**Month (only) 116**] have some diastolic dysfunction not assessed on\nprior echo. [**Month (only) 116**] also have third-spacing [**12-29**] hyponatremia.\nNephrotic syndrome unlikely given U/A. ? of new ascites which is\nlikely related to his increased metastatic disease. Started on\nhigh protein diet.\n.\n# Metastatic pancreatic Cancer: Evidence of progression of CT\nabdomen/pelvis. Of note, OB positive stool seen in the setting\nof known GI malignancy but with relatively stable Hct. He has\nbeen offered palliative chemotherapy and radiation treatment,\nwhich he has declined. Family meeting was held with palliative\ncare and oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] present. Decision made to discharge\npt home with hospice but to remain full code given hope of\nseeing son who will be arriving from [**Location (un) 6847**] in 2 weeks.\n.\n# Afib: Off coumadin given h/o allergy. Was in RVR during\nhospitalization but not rate controlled given low-running BP\nalthough he remained hemodynamically stable.\n.\n# Nutrition: Speech & swallow and Nutrition recommended high\nprotein, pureed solids, nectar-thick liquids. Maintained on 1L\nfluid restriction.\n.\n# DVT ppx: Pneumoboots.\n.\n# Code: FULL, as discussed at family mtg.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nLevofloxacin 750mg PO daily x 5 days (4/24-28/09) to complete\n7-day course\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. Cefpodoxime 100 mg/5 mL Suspension for Reconstitution Sig:\nTwo Hundred (200) mg PO twice a day for 4 days.\nDisp:*1600 mg* Refills:*0*\n\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nHome\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary\n- Hyponatremia\n- Hospital acquired pneumonia\nSecondary\n- Metastatic pancreatic cancer\n- Atrial fibrillation\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nStable\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nYou were admitted for increasing cough and lethargy. You were\ntreated for a pneumonia, and we are giving you a prescription to\ncomplete an antibiotic course at home. You were also found to\nhave a very low sodium level. This is thought to be due to an\nunderlying metabolic problem which was exacerbated by too much\nwater intake at home. You should not drink more than 800 cc of\nwater daily.\n.\nPlease note that we found a blood clot in your splenic vein.\nHowever, you were not started on blood thinners as the risks\noutweighed the benefits.\n.\nThe following changes were made to your medications:\n- cefpodoxime - this is an antibiotic to treat your pneumonia.\n.\nAs discussed during the family meeting, you will be sent home\nwith hospice care. Please seek medical attention if you develop\nfevers or chills, increased difficulty breathing, chest pain, or\nany other concerning symptoms.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nYou have the following upcoming appointments already scheduled:\n- [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD. Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 22**]. Date/Time:[**2189-4-3**] @\n1:00pm.\n- [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD. Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 22**]. Date/Time:[**2189-4-29**] @\n1:30pm.\n\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2189-4-2**]"
