Upon admission a discussion was held with the\ndaughter (official HCP). She wished to make her mother DNR. She\nwas told the risk of developing hydrocephalus and need for EVD\nplacement. She said she would think about this but was not sure\nif she would want to proceed with it.\n\nOvernight on [**3-27**] - [**3-28**] the patient became less responsive. A\nhead CT was obtained which revealed developing hydrocephalus.\nThe daughter was [**Name (NI) 653**] and said that she did not want to\nproceed with the EVD. The patient was made CMO at that time and\nextubated at approximately 6AM.\n\nThe daughter [**Name (NI) 653**] the ICU later in the morning and\nrequested that the patient be transferred to [**Hospital3 15402**] so that\nshe would be closer to home.
