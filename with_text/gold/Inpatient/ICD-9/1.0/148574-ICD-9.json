He was initially treated for\npneumonia with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. On the afternoon of\nadmission, he was noted to be acutely aphasic, with word finding\ndifficulty. There was concern for acute stroke. Neurology was\nconsulted, he was transferred to the ICU, and a stat head CT was\nperformed. Given that he was also febrile with an elevated WBC\ncount to 27 with 27% bands, an LP was performed. This revealed\n7800 WBCs with 94% polys, a glucose of 5, and a protein of 447.\nHe was initially covered with vanc/CTX/ampicillin/acyclovir. CSF\nand blood cultures from [**2-13**] grew strep pneumo. ID was consulted,\nand recommended PCN G and rifampin, which were started on\n[**2157-2-13**]. He was followed by neurology and ID. He steadily\nimproved and was transferred out fo the ICU on [**2157-2-15**]. An MRI\nperformed [**2157-2-16**] showed right cerebral meningeal enhancement c/w\nhis h/o meningitis, as well as concern for mastoiditis\n(non-communicating with the meninges). There was no evidence of\nabscess or hemorrhage, but a small frontal hygroma vs. subdural\nempyema. Nsurg was consulted, and there was NTD per them.\n\nOn [**2-19**], ENT performed a right myringotomy, and a copious amount\nof seromucoid purulent material was aspirated; tubes were\nplaced. Per his report, later that day he developed tingling of\nboth upper extremities and the LLE, as well as left hand\nweakness and general poor coordination. Neurology was\nre-consulted, and exam revealed left sided neglect and poor\ncoordination without frank dysmetria. A repeat MRI was\nperformed, the preliminary report of which showed evidence of\ncerebritis. Plans were initiated tranfer him to the [**Hospital1 18**] neuro\nICU, but they refused. He was instead accepted by the MICU.\nPrior to transfer, rifampin was resumed, and keppra was begun\nfor seizure ppx. His temp was 100.2 and he was hemodynamically\nstable.\n\nOn arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU, he complained of nausea. He\nendorsed ongoing numbness in his hands and feet since\nyesterday's ear operation.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nPMH:\n1. CAD - s/p MI in [**2138**], [**2151**] tx with angioplasty\n2.

Since his transfer here, Mr. [**Known lastname 410**] has remained\nafebrile, with a WBC trending down.  Clinically, Mr. [**Known lastname 410**]\nimproved dramatically over the course of his stay to the point\nwhere no neurological deficits can be noted noted. He has no\nmeningeal signs at present.\n.\n#Cerebritis - Empyema was followed serially by CT and MR imaging\nwithout any change over his stay.  There was no involvement of\nthe sinuses.  The decision was made on [**2156-2-29**] by medicine,\nneurosurgery, and ID to surgically drain the fluid collection\nvia stereotactic biopsy.\n.\n# Mastoiditis-  Patient has ear tubes bilaterally that have\ndrained minimally.  He has remained afebrile since his arrival\nand w/o pain.  Hearing remains sensitive to loud snaps only.  He\ncontinues on Ciprofloxicin ear drops 0.3% Ophth Soln 4-10 drops\nto the right ear.\n.\n# Seizure - Patient had a single generalized, tonic clonic\nseizure in the MICU on [**2156-2-20**] while on Keppra 500mg.\nMetronidazole was stopped temporarily and the patient was loaded\nwith additional Keppra. Pt has not seized since MICU stay.  He\nremains on Keppra, now tritrated up to 1g for neurosurgical\nintervention.\n.\n# HTN - Mr. [**Known lastname 410**] was never hypotensive during his stay and his\npressures largely ranged in the 130s sytolic.  Metoprolol was\nstarted at 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] and titrated up to 50 mg tid, with the\ndischarge goal of home dosing of 200mg qd.\n.\n#Diabetes - Mr. [**Known lastname 410**] was initially covered under a sliding\nscale.  When full diet was resumed, his glucose values were in\nthe high 200s.  Medication was changed to pt's home PO metformin\nand glyburide, with modest effect.  Hyperglycemia thought to be\nresultant of stress and illness.\n.\n#CAD, hx of MI - Stable, no events.  Continued statin.  Given\npossibility of intervention, ASA was held throughout the stay.\n.\n#Anemia - Pt was down from baseline of 47.7 in [**2155**] to 37.8.\nBecause of history of cold agglutinin hemolysis, patient was\nworked up for anemia.  Haptoglobin was within normal limits.\nIron labs were consistent with anemia of inflammation, with\nnormal MCV, lower transferrin, and lower TIBC.\n\nOn [**3-2**] he was brought to the OR by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a\nsteriotactic burr hole placement and washout of subdural\nempyema. He tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the\nfloor where he ambulated with nursing and tolerated a regular\ndiet. He was then safe to be d/c'd home with services and follow\nup appointment\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nHome Meds:\nLipitor 40 mg\nASA 650 mg daily\nGlucophage 1000mg [**Hospital1 **]\nGlyburide 3.75mg [**Hospital1 **]\nToprol XL 200 mg\nMVI\n.\nTransfer Meds:\nRifampin\nKeppra 250mg po bid ([**2-20**] - )\nRISS\nFloxin otic gtt to right ear [**Hospital1 **]\nPCN G 4 million units q4h IV\nmetformin 1000mg [**Hospital1 **]\ntylenol q4h prn prn\nmetoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **]\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

While you were here, you\nreceived intravenous antibiotics, anti-seizure medication, and\nrepeated imaging of your brain. The medicine, [**Hospital 1083**]\ndisease, and neurosurgery teams decided that having surgical\ndrainage of the [**Hospital 1083**] collection around your brain would\nbest help clear the infection.\n\nYou were started on the following NEW medications, all of which\nyou will continue:\n1. Ceftriaxone 2 g IV Q12H\n2. Metronigazole (Flagyl) 500 mg PO Q8H\n3. Ciprofloxicin Ear Drops\n4. Levitracetam 1g PO BID\n\nThe first medication will be given through the picc line in your\narm.
