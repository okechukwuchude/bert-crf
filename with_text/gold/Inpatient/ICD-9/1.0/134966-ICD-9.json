CTA demonstrating likely\n anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  Endovascular angiography with\n possible intervention.\n\n OPERATORS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2269**] [**Name (STitle) **] (attending physician), Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 11758**] [**Name (STitle) 4652**] (fellow),\n [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 20261**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4220**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1813**] (resident).\n\n PROCEDURE PERFORMED:\n 1.  Left common and internal carotid angiography.\n 2.  Coiling of left anterior communicating artery aneurysm.\n\n RADIATION:  Fluoro time 39.9 minutes; source A:  1492 mGy; source B:  455 mGy.\n\n ANESTHESIA:  Procedure performed under general anesthesia.  Please see\n separate anesthesia report for details.\n\n PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  Written informed consent was obtained from the\n patient prior to the procedure, explaining the risks, benefits and\n alternatives.  The patient was brought to the angiography suite under general\n anesthesia and placed supine on the angiography table.  A timeout was\n performed per [**Hospital1 351**] protocol.  The patient then underwent an external\n ventricular drain procedure performed by the neurosurgery team and reported\n separately.  Following this, both groins were prepped and draped in the usual\n sterile fashion.  Access was gained to the right femoral artery with a\n 19-gauge single-wall needle.  A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 180**] wire was advanced to the\n thoracic aorta and a 6 French Terumo sheath placed.\n\n Extensive atherosclerotic disease was noted throughout the common femoral\n arteries, aorta and origins of the major intracranial vessels.  Initial\n attempts to cannulate the great vessels of the aortic arch were unsuccessful.\n A 5 French [**Doctor Last Name **] 2 catheter was then formed across the aortic bifurcation in the\n pelvis and advanced to the aortic arch.  In combination with Glidewire, the\n [**Doctor Last Name **] 2 catheter was advanced to the left common carotid artery.  Angiography\n was performed from this position demonstrating a 6 x 5 mm wide-neck aneurysm\n with irregular walls consistent with rupture arising from the anterior\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2197-8-8**] 1:09 PM\n CAROT/CEREB [**Hospital1 **]                                                  Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 75030**]\n Reason: eval for endovascular intervention for active extravasation\n  Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 290\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n communicating artery.  Extensive atherosclerotic disease was again noted with\n moderate stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.  The findings were\n discussed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at this time and, given the difficulty\n with access, the decision was made to proceed immediately with aneurysm\n coiling without additional diagnostic angiography.\n\n A 6 Fr straight Neuron catheter was placed over an exchange length Glidewire\n and a SL-10 microcatheter with Synchro 2, 0.014 wire was used to access the\n anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  After positioning the tip of the\n microcatheter within the aneurysm, a Target 360 Ultra 5 mm x 10 cm detachable\n coil was placed and deployed into the aneurysm sac.\n\n After placement of the first coil, the microcatheter tip came back into the\n parent artery due to tortuosity. Subsequently, the microcatheter could not be\n readily advanced into the aneurysm. Attmepts to reposition the tip of the\n catheter into the anuerysm was unsuccessful. At this time, the patient's blood\n pressure transiently increased raising a suspicion of possible leak of the\n aneursym. However follow up angiogram demonstrates no active extravasation of\n the contrast noted. This case was again discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Given the\n transient blood pressure increase and extensive tortuosity of the vessels\n limiting catheter manipulation, the decision was made to terminate the\n procedure and send the patient to obtain a CT scan of the head.  No additional\n coils could be placed. Post-coiling angiography demonstrated appropriate\n placement of the coil within the aneurysm sac.  A smaller aneurysm measuring\n approximately 2 x 1 mm at the bifurcation of the left carotid/origin of left\n MCA and ACA (15A:14) may also be present.  The catheters were withdrawn and\n the 25-cm Terumo sheath was replaced with a 6 French 10-cm Terumo sheath which\n was secured to the groin with a single 0 silk suture.  Sterile dressing was\n applied.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n 1.  Large, approximately 6 x 5 mm wide-neck anterior communicating artery\n aneurysm with irregular walls, consistent with rupture. Due to extensive\n atherosclerotic disease, limiting catheter access to the great vessels,\n angiography was performed from the left common and internal carotid only.\n\n 2.  Coiling of anterior communicating artery aneurysm with single Target 360 5\n mm x 10 cm coil. Given the extreme difficulty in cathterizing the aneurysm\n with the microcatheter, due to severe tortuosity of vessels and\n atherosclerotic disease, 'surgical clipping' of the residual aneurysm\n recommended.\n\n 3.  6 French 10 cm Terumo sheath left in place in right groin.  The patient\n was sent directly to CT from the angiography suite.\n\n Findings discussed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] during and subsequently at the\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2197-8-8**] 1:09 PM\n CAROT/CEREB [**Hospital1 **]                                                  Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 75030**]\n Reason: eval for endovascular intervention for active extravasation\n  Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 290\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n conclusion of the case at 5.20 pm on [**2197-8-8**].\n\n\n\n"

This latter raises concern for a\nsmall amount of extravascular leakage of intravenous contrast.\n\nCXR [**2197-8-8**]:  Adequate position of the ET tube on the third\nimage of the\nseries.  NG tube positioned appropriately.  Rounded opacity in\nthe right upper lung which is concerning for mass lesion versus\ninfection/aspiration.  Followup to resolution is advised\n\nCT Head [**8-9**]: IMPRESSION:\n1.  Unchanged distribution of the diffuse subarachnoid\nhemorrhage, with\ninterval resorption/redistribution of the intraventricular\nhemorrhage, and no new hemorrhage.\n2.  No findings suggestive of acute territorial infarction.\n3.  No change in the shape and size of the lateral ventricles to\nsuggest\nobstructive hydrocephalus, and overall unchanged position of the\nventricular drain.\n\n[**8-9**] CXR:\nET tube is in standard placement, nasogastric tube ends in the\nupper stomach.  Previous large opacity in the right upper lung\nzone is much smaller and less radiodense.  The rapid\ndisappearance suggests this was focal pulmonary hemorrhage, less\nlikely pneumonia given substantial involution in only 24 hours.\nLeft lung is grossly clear.

The right ventricular free wall thickness is\nnormal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Overall right\nventricular function appears preserved. However, there is focal\ndyskinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic valve is not well\nseen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation\nis seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There\nis no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is\nseen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.\nThere is an anterior space which most likely represents a\nprominent fat pad.\n\nIMPRESSION: extensive, segmental wall motion abnormalities of\nthe left ventricle are present\n\n[**8-11**] CXR:\nCONCLUSION:\n1.  Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened.  Small bilateral\npleural effusion\nhas also increased.\n2.

Heterogeneous opacities\npersist in both lungs with relative sparing of the left upper\nlobe.  As compared to the recent exam of one day earlier, there\nare worsening opacities in both lung bases as well as the\ndevelopment of a small left pleural effusion.  The etiology of\nthese findings is uncertain, but they are concerning for\nmultifocal infection in the appropriate clinical setting.\nOutside of the chest, note is made of dense calcifications in\nthe expected location of the right carotid artery.\n\nBILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2197-8-15**] 9:28 AM\nIMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.\n\nCTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of [**2197-8-16**] 12:44 PM\nIMPRESSION:\n\n1.

Tracheostomy is in the standard position.\nThere is no pneumothorax.\n\nEEG Study Date of [**2197-8-19**]\n\nFINDINGS:\nThis was a continuous ICU EEG monitoring starting at 18:08 a.m.\non [**8-19**] through 7:00 a.m. on [**8-20**].\nCONTINUOUS EEG: The background activity shows a disorganized\n8-8.5 Hz alpha\nrhythm which attenuates with eye opening. There are bursts of\nbilateral\nfrontal high amplitude delta slowing at 2-3 Hz with occasional\nembedded sharp\nwaves. The sharp waves do not appear to be periodic or clear\nepileptiform\ndischarges. There is also slightly more slowing over the right\ncentral\ntemporal region. There are also some bilateral frontal central\nsharp waves\nand slow sharp waves recorded. They do not appear to be periodic\nor evolving\ninto electrographic seizures.\nSPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There are numerous automated spike\ndetections\npredominantly for bilateral frontal central sharp waves and slow\nsharp.\nSEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There are many automated seizure\ndetections\npredominantly for bursts of left frontal slowing with embedded\nsharp waves.\nThe rest of the seizure detection captures muscle and electrode\nartifact.\nThere were no electrographic seizures.\nQUANTITATIVE EEG: Trend analysis is performed with Persyst Magic\nMarker\nsoftware. Panels include automated seizure detection, rhythmic\nrun detection\nand display, color spectral density array, absolute and relative\nasymmetry\nindices, asymmetry spectrogram, amplitude integrated EEG, burst\nsuppression\nratio, envelope trend, and alpha delta ratios.\nPUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There are no pushbutton activations.\nSLEEP: The patient progresses from wakefulness to stage II which\nis\ncharacterized by partially formed sleep spindles, then\nprogressed to slow wave\nsleep.\nCARDIAC MONITOR: Shows a generally regular rhythm with an\naverage rate of\n60-70 bpm with occasional PVCs.\nIMPRESSION: This is an [**Month (only) **] continuous ICU monitoring study.\nThe\nbackground activity seems somewhat disorganized although it\nstill maintains as alpha rhythm. There is multifocal slowing\nover bilateral frontal region, as well as right central temporal\nregion. This could be multifocal structural lesions. There are\nalso some non-periodic bilateral frontal central sharp waves.\nThey do not appear to evolve into electrographic seizures but\ncould be potentially epileptogenic.

No finding to suggest the development of cerebral vasospasm\nand no\nevidence of developing vascular territorial infarction, (though\nno dedicated perfusion sequence was performed).\n2.  Status post coiling of large ACom aneurysm with adjacent\nsmall right\nfrontal parenchymal hematoma, unchanged over the series of\nrecent studies; the overall extent of subarachnoid blood is also\nunchanged.\n3.  Status post removal of external ventricular drainage\ncatheter with stable layering intraventricular blood and a small\namount of air, and no finding to suggest developing\nhydrocephalus.\n\nEEG [**2109-8-20**]\npending final reads prelim: NO seizures\n\nCHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2197-8-20**] 3:45 AM\n\nREASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Tracheostomy in a patient with\nsubarachnoid\nhemorrhage with copious secretions.\n\nPortable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison\nto [**8-18**], [**2196**].\n\nTracheostomy is in place.  The tip is approaching 4.3 cm above\nthe carina.  Left subclavian line tip is at the mid SVC.  Heart\nsize and mediastinum are unchanged.  Widespread parenchymal\nconsolidations appear to be slightly improved since the prior\nstudy with no new consolidations demonstrated and might reflect\ngradual decrease of a combination of pulmonary edema and\ninfectious process.\n\nCHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2197-8-21**] 4:49 AM\n\nReportIMPRESSION:\nPreliminary Report1. New right upper lung opacity concerning for\npneumonia.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. [**Known lastname 14879**] was seen in the [**Hospital1 **] ED by Neurosurgery. CTA imaging\nshowed a large ACA aneurysm and she intubated for EVD and\ncerebral angiogram. She got platelets for ASA use. This\nangiogram showed a R ACOM aneurysm that was coiled. Bright red\nblood was seen in the EVD catether and angiogram was aborted in\nfear of rerupturing the aneurysm. She was taken to CT for a stat\nhead CT which showed small IPH vs contrast. She was taken to the\nICU intubated and sedated. Blood pressure was stricty controlled\nbetween 100-140 SBP. On [**8-9**], patient remained intubated and off\nsedation, she opened her eyes to voice and followed commands in\nall 4 extremities. She was taken to angiogram for a repeat angio\nand her aneurysm was coiled and secured. She was taken back to\nthe SICU for further monitoring and remained stable overnight.\nSBP was liberalized 100-200.\n\nOn [**8-10**] she was EO to voice and following commands with all of\nher extremities. Her groin site was c/d/i. She was started on\nSQH and had baseline TCD's. TCD's were mildly elevated in the L\nMCA and R ICA. She was extubated but noted to be tachypnic and\nLS with rhonchi. Overnight she had increased urine output for\nmultiple hours and serum sodium was increasing with decreasing\nspecific gravity. She was treated with 2mcg DDAVP with good\neffect. She was also noted to be delerious which was treated\nwith zyprexa. On [**8-11**] she was neurologically stable but\ncontinued to have some respiratory distress. Her IVF's were\ncontinued due to concern for vasospasm. Late morning she\nrequired re-intubation due to respiratory distress. Her IVF were\nthen decreased to 50ml/hr.\n\nOn [**8-12**] she continued to be febrile and requiring the cooling\nblanket. Her exam was stable. Her EVD continued to be open at\n15.\n\nOn [**8-13**] she had a CTA head which showed no vasospasm.\n\nOn [**8-14**], her EVD was raised to 20. She remained febrile and CSF\nwas sent. The gram stain showed no microorganisms. Her HCT 24\nbut asymptomatic thus we opted to follow. Cardiac enzymes were\nsent and her Troponin was elevated.\n\nOn [**8-15**]: plan for Tracheostomy & PEG was discussed with daughter\nand plan was made to ok to proceed with the procedures.  The\nCerebral Spinal Fluid gram stain (-) but with many PMN. The\nTroponins were downtrending in the context of likely\nTakotsubo's, stopped cycling. No Deep Vein Thrombosis on lower\nextremity ultrasound [**8-16**]\n\nOn [**8-16**]: There was decreased right arm movement lead to repeat\nCTA in PM. The CTA Head revealed no signs of vasospasm.\nTranscranial Dopplers in AM revealed velocities of 60-70s.\nClinically the patient was improving and was moving right arm in\nthe evening. The External Ventricular Drain was clamped with no\nincrease in Intercranial Pressure overnight. Plan to repeat CTA\nof the Head in AM to eval for hydrocephalus.\n\nOn [**8-17**]: The Transcranial Dopplers in am were 30-40, repeat Head\nCT in the morning to rule out hydrocephalus. The patient\nunderwent Tracheostomy and PEG today.  sedation and the\nventilator was weaned as tolerated.  Transcranial Dopplers were\nin 30s. CT scan of the Head showed stable ventricles with\nExternal Ventricular drain clamped over 24 hours.\n\nOn [**8-18**], The patient had been on the Tracheostomy collar from 8\nam to 8 pm.  The patient was out of bed to the chair. The\npatient was febrile to 101.4. Cerebral Spinal Fluid, Urine and\nsputum were cultured. Restarted ASA 81mg per neurosurgery. The\nExternal Ventricular Drain was electively discontinued in the\nevening. Intravenous medications were transitioned to pill form.\n The arterial line was discontinued.  A Chest radiolgraph was\nconsistent with increased pleural effusions. The patient\ntolerated CPAP ventilation peep of 5/and pressure support of 5\novernight. On Exam, the patient was Reponsive and moving all\nextremities.\n\nOn [**8-19**], A PICC ordered for continued antibiotic thereapy. A CTA\nHead was ordered.  There was no evidence of new hemorhage. A EEG\nordered as the patient was suspected seizures x2 while febrile.\nThe patient was administered  IV Ativan and Tylenol.\n\nOn [**8-20**], The patient continued 24hr EEG which was negative for\nseizures. The patient had a low-grade temp in AM and procedded\nto spike to 101.3 around 2pm. The Nurse [**First Name (Titles) 8706**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] patient\nbehavior which included slight downward gaze and increased\npupillary size on R>L (baseline anisocoria). The patent remained\nalert and oriented without  motor deficits. The epilepsy\nattending was constacted ( Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] )and there was no\nseizure activity noted on EEG. Continued on vancomycin/cefepime\nfor presumed Pneumonia.\n\nOn [**8-21**], the patient was in stable on neurological exam.  She\nwas lfted out of bed to the chair.  The patient's CXR was\nconsistent with New right upper lung opacity concerning for\npneumonia and was continued on vancomycin and cefepime for her\npneumonia.  The EEG was negative for seizure and the EEG was\ndiscontinued. The patient hematocrit was stable at 22.8 and a\nhemoglobin of 7.6.  This was discussed with the intensive care\nteam and given stable chronic nature of hematocrit the patient\nwas not transfused.
