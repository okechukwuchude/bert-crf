Unchanged bilateral basal pleural scarring, more evident\non the right than on the left side of the thorax. No acute\npulmonary or cardiac changes, no pleural effusions. No\npneumothorax. No focal parenchymal opacities indicative of\npneumonia.\n\n[**12-16**] CT abdomen/pelvis:\nCT ABDOMEN: The visualized lung bases are clear. There is no\npleural or\npericardial effusion. Pleural thickening or atelectasis is seen\nin the right lower lobe (2:7).\n\nPatient is status post Puestow procedure with suture lines in\nthe jejunum, not well assessed on this study. Pancreatic\ncalcifications are consistent with known chronic pancreatitis.\nThere is no evidence of pseudocyst or acute pancreatitis. The\nliver is normal without focal liver lesion identified.\nPneumobilia throughout the mildly dilated intrahepatic biliary\ntree is re-demonstrated as seen on MRI. The patient is status\npost cholecystectomy. The spleen and right adrenal gland are\nnormal. Mild thickening of the medial limb of the left adrenal\ngland is similar to [**2175-1-30**]. The kidneys enhance symmetrically\nand excrete contrast promptly without hydronephrosis.\n\nLack of intra-abdominal fat makes evaluation of the bowel\nsuboptimal. There is marked small bowel wall thickening to 9 mm\n(2:42), which is nonspecific. There is no small bowel\nobstruction. The large bowel are normal in course and caliber\nwithout obstruction. There is no free fluid and no free air. No\npathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph\nnodes are identified, although evaluation is limited by lack of\nintra-abdominal fat. Main portal vein, splenic vein and SMV are\npatent.\n\nThe proximal aorta is of normal caliber with a significant\namount of\natherosclerotic calcifications. There is luminal narrowing of\nthe distal aorta with eccentric intraluminal thrombus. There is\nminimal to no flow in the right common iliac artery. The right\ncommon iliac artery at the bifurcation of the internal and\nexternal iliac arteries is patent. The right external iliac\nartery is attenuated. The left common iliac and external iliac\narteries are patent. The bilateral internal iliac arteries are\nnot well assessed due to extensive atherosclerotic\ncalcifications.\n\nCT PELVIS: The rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder and prostate are\nnormal. There is no free fluid and no inguinal lymphadenopathy.\n\nBONE WINDOWS: No bone finding suspicious for infection or\nmalignancy is seen.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Pancreatic calcifications consistent with known chronic\npancreatitis. No evidence of pseudocyst or acute pancreatitis.\n2. Diffuse small bowel wall thickening is nonspecific and may be\nrelated to hypoperfusion, infection, or inflammation. No bowel\nobstruction, free\nintra-abdominal fluid or free air.\n3. Occlusion of the right common iliac artery as described\nabove.\n\nStudies:\nLE Arterial Duplex:FINDINGS: The ABI on the right is 0.71 and on\nthe left is 0.69.

The exact cause is unclear, but it is likely a\nreflection of pancreatic destruction from pancreatitis as his\nblood sugars were very sensitive to insulin during\nhospitalization. He was initially admitted to the ICU where he\nwas treated with an insulin gtt and then transitioned to\nsubcutaneous insulin. He was seen by [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes team and he\nwas discharged on Lantus 4units QAM. Given the patients erratic\nfood intake including during flares of his pancreatitis,\ncombined with his history of poor medical followup, there was\nconcern that insulin may be associated with increased risk of\nhypoglycemia in the patient. However, he had finger sticks of\n300-400 consistently during hospitalization after he resumed a\nregular diet so the decision was made to discharge the patient\non a regimen of low dose Lantus insulin alone. Extensive time\nwas spent teaching the patient how to accurately and\nappropriately check his finger sticks and administer his insulin\nand when to call doctors and of the warning signs of hyper and\nhypoglycemia. Patient was discharged with plan to be in close\ncommunication with his PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) **] re: insulin titration.\n\n#Acute on chronic pancreatitis:\nPatient's abdominal pain was felt to represent acute on chronic\npancreatitis. Pain improved over hospitalization and patient was\ndischarged on home pain regimen tolerating a diet. He was\ncontinued on Creon.\n\n# Occluded/Stenotic common iliac artery: Seen incidentally on CT\nscan on admission. Patient did endorse claudication. He was seen\nby the Vascular Surgery service and will follow up in Vascular\nSurgery outpatient clinic.\n\n#Dispostion: Patient was discharged home to follow up with his\nPCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], and Vascular Surgery\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nOXYCONTIN 15 MG  XR 1 tab po twice daily\nOXYCODONE HCL TABS 15 MG po q3-4 hr prn\nCREON [**Numeric Identifier 17514**] UNIT CPEP (PANCRELIPASE (LIP-PROT-AMYL)) [**1-26**] with\neach main meal and [**11-25**] with snacks\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

You were treated in the Intensive Care Unit with\nIV insulin and then given insulin on the medical floor. You were\nalso found to have a flare of your pancreatitis which improved\nover the course of your hospitalization and you were able to\ntolerate a regular diet prior to discharge.\n\nYou were seen by the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes service and were taught how\nto give yourself insulin injections and check your blood sugars\nusing finger sticks.\n\nYou should take your Lantus insulin in the morning and check\nyour blood sugars before meals and before bedtime. Please lower\nyour insulin dose if you are not eating or if your blood sugars\nare low. You should also keep juice, or non-diet soda,\nchocolates or sweets with you to take in case your finger stick\nreadings are less than 70 or if you feel tremulous, start\nsweating, notice vision changes, or feel as if you are going to\npass out.\n\nPlease be in close communication with your PCP and the [**Name9 (PRE) **]\ncenter regarding your sugars so that your insulin dosing may be\nadjusted as needed.\n\nPlease call your 911 if your blood sugars are continually\nelevated above 500 or if you have low blood sugars with symptoms\nthat do not improve with sugar containing compounds such as\njuice, soda, chocolate, or sweets.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\n1) Please make an appointment to see your PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
