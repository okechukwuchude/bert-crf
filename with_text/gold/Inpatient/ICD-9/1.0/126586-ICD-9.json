Apparently pt vomiting earlier\nin the day, then noted to desaturate down to 70s off vent and\nbecame apneic (up until this point pt had been doing well off\nthe vent per report). He has been placed back on the vent since\nthe desaturations and is noted to be tachypnic.\n.\nInitially presented on [**2119-4-13**] with complaints of difficulty\nswallowing and productive cough and who was found to have a\nright base pneumonia.  A failed swallow evaluation prompted a CT\nneck that revealed a tracheoesophageal fistula just below the\nlevel of the thoracic inlet, confirmed via barium swallow, then\nat bronchoscopy. TE fistula  determined to be benign by\npathological exam of biopsies.  After J-tube placement for\nnutrition support, the TE fistula was repaired and esophageal\nstricture resected on [**2119-8-3**]. This was c/b left vocal cord\nparalysis after the operation (had to remove left recurrent\nlaryngeal nerve), and required tracheostomy from respiratory\nfailure after anastomotic incompetence on [**2119-8-18**]. Since\ndischarge after an admission [**2119-10-3**] - [**2119-11-8**] for large bowel\nobstruction, he has been weaned from the ventilator to trach\ncollar with humidified air. She continued to have a TEF and\nunderwent a rigid bronchoscopy with fibrin injection into the\nfistula on [**2120-1-22**]. Apparently the fibrin clotted the fistula\nand he was admitted overnight for monitoring, though no other\ncomplications per OMR.\n.\nIn the ED, initial vs were:  T98.6 HR88 BP106/76 PO288% (though\nnoted to be difficult to get an accurate sat). CXR showed right\nupper lobe opacity concerning for PNA, pulmonary vascular\ncongestion and small b/l pleural effusions. EKG was reportedly\nunremarkable. ABG was 7.41/38/184/25 on pressure support\nventilation. Remarkable labs include lactate 2.7, WBC 13.7 with\n94% PMN no bands, Na 147. Patient was given levaquin in the ED\n(ordered also for CTX and levaquin, but not yet received).\nPatient was noted to gradually drop systolic pressure to 70's.\nFelt to be mentating well in the ED, though orientation was not\nassessed. No UOP as per ED resident. Received 2L IVF. On the way\nto the ICU, levophed gtt was started for hypotension.\n\n.\nOn arrival to ICU, patient noted to have low tidal volumes,\nelevated airway pressures, BP's in 70's systolic, and\nsaturations in 70's to 80's. With anesthesia and RT at bedside,\ntrach was repositioned (likely had been auto-PEEPing). Bronch\nperformed which showed trach well-seated in trachea. Currently\npt states breathing more comfortable, c/o pain at site of\nabdominal wound. Denies CP, states intermittent diarrhea. States\nhe doesn't remember what brought him to the hospital. Does not\nrecall vomiting.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\n-Hypertension\n-Hypothyroidism\n-Prostate cancer s/p XRT\n-h/o esophageal CA s/p XRT with 3-hole esohagectomy in [**2104**] at\n[**Hospital1 112**].

Contrast opacification of the large bowel with further small\nbowel\nopacification, if an enteroenteric fistula is suspect, further\nevaluation with\nfluroscopy or an abdominal radiograph is suggested to localize\nthe small bowel\nloop and assess a potential fistulous communication with large\nbowel.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n67yoM h/o squamous cell esophageal cancer s/p XRT with a gastric\npull-up in [**2104**] w/ subsequent tracheo-esophageal fistula and\neventual tracheostomy/ PEG tube placement who presents from\nrehab with respiratory distress.\n.\n# Shock: Pt with BP in 70s/40s on arrival to the MICU and\nfebrile to 101. Lactate 2.7 -> 3.2 -> 1.8 in first 24 hours with\n~7-8L of fluid. Was initially on levophed but this was weaned by\nhospital day #2. Antibiotics were started on arrival to the ICU\n- were eventually broadened to meropenem/linezolid as patient\nhad persistent hypotension. CXR showed new RUL infiltrate\nconcerning for pneumonia. U/A looked infected. Sputum culture\ngrew morganella morganii, sensitive to meropenem - identical\nculture to earlier admission. Patient's lactate normalized and\nhe was weaned off pressors. He was continued on meropenem for\ng-negative rods in sputum and finished his course on [**2-1**].\n.\n# Hypoxemic respiratory distress: Given timing of hypoxic\nrespiratory distress, likely had aspiration event most\nimmediately. On arrival to the floor, patient was seen by\nanesthesia and a bronchoscopy was performed out of concern for\ntrach displacement. The trach was visualized in the correct\nlocation. The patient was initially ventilated on A-C, but this\nwas weaned and on ICU day #2 was on PSV. Antibiotics were\nadministered as above out of concern for RUL pneumonia. The\npatient's trach was changed on HD #2 because of problems with\nongoing cuffleaks. The original trach was found to have a\ndefective balloon. The patient's tidal volumes improved with new\ntrach. The patient remained stable from a respiratory standpoint\nfor the rest of his MICU stay and tolerated trach mask; he was\nsatting in the high 90s on 50% trach mask prior to discharge.\n.\n# TE fistula: Pt is s/p fibrin injection [**2120-1-22**]. Patient with\nknown TEF s/p recent injection. On HD #5, IP performed a\nbronchoscopy, which showed a partially closed TE fistula. The\npatient had 2 episodes of bilious contents being suctioned from\nhis trach. Thoracic surgery was consulted and attempted to place\nan NG tube endoscopically; the attempt was not successful given\nhis complicated anatomy and will not attempt again. IP has no\nplans to attempt another injection for pts TE fistula.\n.\n# J tube leakage: The patient has had a chronic problem with his\njtube leaking and has had it changed 3 times in the recent past.\nThe patient had continued profuse leakage while in the MICU. His\ntube feeds were stopped and PPN was started. Surgery was\nconsulted who recommended a KUB with gastrografin, which was\nnormal. care was also consulted. Patient complained of abdominal\npain and received prn IV morphine. Abd exam was benign.\nThoracics recommended a barium swallow through the j tube with\nsmall bowel follow through showed no abnormalities. Given this,\ntube feeds were re-started on [**1-31**]. Thoracics will not attempt\nto replace the j-tube given his complicated anatomy.\n.\n# Anemia: The patient had a Hct of 20.5 on ICU day #2. Stool was\nguaiac negative. He was transfused 2U PRBC with appropriate\nresponse. Iron studies showed elevated ferritin (likely as acute\nphase reactant). His Hct stayed stable ~27 to 28 for the\nremainder of his hospitalization.\n.\n# Hypernatremia - Na in the 145-150 range; stable over recent\nadmissions. TF and free water flushes were utilized. Na was\ntrended daily and improved to the normal range for the remainder\nof his admission.\n.\n# Prophylaxis was with subcutaneous heparin. Communication was\nwith the patient and Daughter [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2184**] [**Known lastname 93756**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 93877**].

We treated you with IV fluids, blood\npressure-supporting medications, and antibiotics and you\nimproved. You were initially on a breathing machine to help\nsupport your lungs. We believe the source of the low blood\npressure was an infection in your lungs. You were able to\nbreathe well with the trach mask in place prior to your\ndischarge. The pulmonary doctors also looked to see if the\nabnormal connection between your trachea and esophagus was\nhealed - they found that it was partially healed. Finally, we\nhad the thoracic surgeons evaluate your J-tube. A study was\nperformed, which showed that the J-tube was working normally and\nthat you had normal bowel function. You did have leakage around\nthe J-tube but the surgeons thought it would be too dangerous to\nattempt to fix.\n.\nWe made the following changes to your medications:\nWe STOPPED Kayexelate because your potassium levels were normal\nWe STARTED oxycodone 2.5-5 mg (liquid) every 6-8 hours as needed\nfor abdominal pain\nWe STOPPED Prilosec\nWe STARTED Lansoprazole (rapid dissolve tablet) 30 mg once per\nday\n.\nYou should continue to see the medical doctor at your rehab\nfacility.
