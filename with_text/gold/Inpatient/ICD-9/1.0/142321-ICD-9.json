      "text": "TITLE:\n   Date of service: [**2155-7-26**]\n   Initial visit, Cardiology service: CCU\n   Presenting complaint: (Other: Hypotension, tachycardia)\n   History of present illness: In brief, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 year old woman\n   who has a history of coronary artery disease s/p a myocardial\n   infarction in [**2131**] and a large abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Of note,\n   approximately two months ago, the patient was undergoing pre-op\n   evaluation and evaluation of chest pain prior to repair of a 6.6 cm AAA\n   when she was noted to have an abnormal office EKG.  Following this, the\n   patient underwent dobutamine stress test and was found to have\n   upsloping ST segment depressions during the study, subsequently\n   undergoing cardiac catherization on [**2155-6-13**] that revealed 3VD (mid LAD\n   occlusion, 90% LCx, 100% Ostial RCA lesion).  The patient proceeded to\n   CABG earlier this month but was unable to tolerate placement on bypass,\n   and therefore was not revascularized and was maintained on medical\n   therapy for her 3VD.\n   .\n   Two days prior to this admission, the patient presented to outpatient\n   cardiology clinic complaining of dyspnea, and worsening DOE, which was\n   felt to be an anginal equivalent.  Given her symptoms, she was admitted\n   to [**Hospital1 5**] for further evaluation. On admission the patient was found to\n   have a large left sided pleural effusion which was drained and found to\n   be exudative.  She then underwent repeat elective cardiac catherization\n   on [**2155-7-25**], however, cardiac catherization was complicated by a small\n   sprial dissection of the OM1.  The patient was hemodynamically stable\n   following her intervention and returned to the floor.  However, while\n   on the floor the patient was noted to be hypotensive down to a systolic\n   in the 70s and slightly more tachycardic to the low 100's (baseline\n   80's-90's).  After an initial 500cc IVF bolus, the patient's SBP\n   improved to the 100's but one hour later she was noted to have an SBP\n   in the 70s once again.  Given her recent cardiac catherization there\n   was concern for possible pericardial tamponade so a bedside TTE was\n   performed which showed no significant pericardial effusion.  En route\n   to the CCU, the patient was given an additional 500cc IVF bolus with\n   improvement of her SBP to the low 100's and the patient continued to\n   feel well with no symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath.\n   Past medical history: CAD, s/p MI in [**2131**]\n   CHF (EF 45-50%)\n   Diabetes\n   Hyperlipidemia\n   Neuropathy\n   Sciatica\n   Asthma\n   Bursitis of the right shoulder\n   Rotator cuff tear, right shoulder\n   Dry eyes\n   H/O recurrent bronchitis\n   Seasonal allergies\n   GERD\n   H/O Proteinuria in the past\n   Squamous cell ca of the lip s/p resection\n   Tonsillectomy\n   S/P uvula removal\n   Diverticulitis\n   CAD Risk Factors\n   CAD Risk Factors Present\n   Diabetes mellitus, Dyslipidemia\n   CAD Risk Factors Absent\n   Hypertension, Family Hx of CAD, Family Hx of sudden cardiac death\n   (Tobacco: Yes), (Quit: Yes), (Cigarettes: 1 packs / day x 80 yrs)\n   Cardiovascular Procedural History\n   PCI: Most recent: [**2155-7-25**]\n   There is no history of:\n   CABG: Grafts: Not tolerated\n   Pacemaker / ICD\n   Allergies:\n   Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)\n   Unspecified [**Doctor First Name **]\n   Flagyl (Oral) (Metronidazole)\n   Diarrhea;\n   Current medications: MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:\n   Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY Start: In am\n   Clopidogrel 75 mg PO DAILY Start: In am\n   Ciprofloxacin HCl 500 mg PO Q12H\n   Rosuvastatin Calcium 20 mg PO DAILY\n   Gabapentin 300 mg PO Q12H\n   Acetaminophen 325 mg PO Q6H:PRN pain\n   Duloxetine 30 mg PO DAILY Start: In am\n   Milk of Magnesia 30 mL PO Q6H:PRN constipation\n   Insulin SC  (per Insulin Flowsheet)\n   Fluticasone Propionate 110mcg 2 PUFF IH [**Hospital1 **]\n   Salmeterol Xinafoate Diskus (50 mcg) 1 INH IH Q12H\n   Artificial Tears 1-2 DROP BOTH EYES PRN dry eyes\n   Ipratropium Bromide Neb 1 NEB IH Q6H:PRN SOB\n   Albuterol 0.083% Neb Soln 1 NEB IH Q4H:PRN SOB\n   Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID\n   Fexofenadine 60 mg PO BID\n   Heparin 5000 UNIT SC TID\n   Ranitidine 150 mg PO BID\n   Cardiovascular ROS\n   Cardiovascular ROS Signs and Symptoms Present\n   SOB, DOE\n   Cardiovascular ROS Signs and Symptoms Absent\n   Murmur, Rheumatic fever, Chest pain, PND, Orthopnea, Edema,\n   Palpitations, Syncope, Presyncope, Lightheadedness, TIA / CVA,\n   Pulmonary embolism, DVT, Claudication, Exertional buttock pain,\n   Exertional calf pain\n   Cardiovascular ROS Details: Pt w/symptoms of SOB/DOE on admission but\n   not currently\n   Review of Systems\n   Signs and symptoms present\n   Black / red stool, Myalgias\n   Organ system ROS normal\n   Constitutional, Eyes, ENT, Respiratory, Gastrointestinal, Endocrine,\n   Hematology / Lymphatic, Genitourinary, Musculoskeletal, Integumentary,\n   Neurological, Psychiatric, Allergy / Immune\n   Signs and symptoms absent\n   Recent fevers, Chills, Rigors, Cough, Hemoptysis, Bleeding during\n   surgery, Joint pains\n   ROS Details: Pt with history of black stools while on iron\n   supplementation.

The test was stopped due to reaching the target submaximal\n   heart rate. The patient reported a lower RLQ discomfort [**4-8**] during\n   infusion. This symptom resolved after the Dobutamine was terminated. In\n   the presence of baseline changes, between 0.5-1mm of slowly upsloping\n   ST segment depression was seen in the inferior leads and V2-V6 at peak\n   infusion and in early recovery period; returning to baseline later in\n   recovery.

In addition, on admission, pt underwent thoracentesis of\n   L sided pleural effusion and removal of 1.5L possibly causing fluid\n   shifts and relative hypotension.  [**Name2 (NI) **] potential etiologies of\n   hypotension could include dehydration, or less likely medication effect\n   from meds received in the cath lab.

POBA of OM1 with 2.25mm balloon resulting in dissection with\ngood\nflow.\n  FINAL DIAGNOSIS:\n1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.\n2. POBA of OM1\"\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n73F c 3VD and AAA, as well as DM, COPD and MMP now p/w\nincreasing DOE. Pt does have large L pleural effusion s/p cabg\nwhich was drained on [**2155-7-24**], but has been reaccumulating since\nthen. Pt also had cath on [**7-25**] which resulted in a dissected\nLcx. She was admitted to the unit for hypotension on [**7-25**], rp\nbleed and pericardial effusion ruled out and hypotension\nresolved c IVF and decreased bblocker. c/o L shoulder pain which\nseems msk in origin (reproducible by pressing on her shoulder\nand reproducible with abduction of shoulder)\n.\n# CORONARIES: 3VD on cath from [**5-8**], attempted CABG but pt could\nnot tolerate bypass. Now s/p cath on [**7-25**] c no stents,\ndissection of left circumflex. She was ruled out for MI. She was\ncontinued on aspirin and started on plavix, but the plavix was\ndiscontinued as patient did not recieves stents and may need\nthoracentesis or pleurex tube in the next few weeks. Pt had\nepisode of nausea and lightheadedness which was similar to her\nprior MI in [**2130**] on [**2155-7-30**] depressions in V4-V6.\nShe was ruled out for MI, and the EKG had normalized by the next\nday. The ST depressions were attributed to demand [**3-3**]\ntachycardia. Pt was continued on rosuvastatin.\n.\n# PUMP: Pt c systolic CHF c EF of ~40%. Her metoprolol was\ndecreased from 25 [**Hospital1 **] to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] as her blood pressures were\nconsistently in the 90s on the higher dose. Of note, pt has\nhypotensive for several hours on the day following her first\nthoracentesis (pericardial eff and RP bleed were ruled out) and\npt responded well to 1LNS.\n.\n# RHYTHM: Pt was in sinus rhythm and monitored on telemetry\nthroughout her admission. Her rate was usually in the high 90s.\n.\n# L PLEURAL EFFUSION: Pt was found to have a large left pleural\neffusion believed to be [**3-3**] her recent CABG. She received\ndiagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis on admission which\nreaccumulated over ~36 hours. Pt recieved a second thoracentesis\non [**7-28**] with a small amount of reaccumulation, but less than the\nfirst time. Both samples were sent for analysis and were found\nto be exudative which is consistent with post-cabg pleural\neffusion. Fluid was also sent for cytology, which is pending. Pt\nwas started on lasix 20 to try to limit reaccumulation, which\nshe tolerated well.\n.\n# COPD/asthma-continued home COPD/asthma medicines. Pt did\noccasionally recieve albuterol nebs with good result.\n.\n# L SHOULDER PAIN: Pt had some left shoulder pain which\ndeveloped after her first thoracentesis and radiated to her\nelbow, likely musculoskeletal in origin (though pt was ruled out\nfor MI again when she had this pain). She will follow up with\nher PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 1 week.\n.\n# OSTEOPENIA: Pt was found to be osteopenic by cxr, and was\nstarted on calcium and vitamin D. She may benefit from a dexa\nscan as an oupatient.\n.\n# ANEMIA: improved from baseline, trended throughout her\nadmission. Felt to likely be [**3-3**] her MMP.\n.\n# continued rest of home meds (allergy meds, neuropathic pain\nmeds)\n.\n# DM: d/ced rosiglitazone and started on ISS as inpt. Her blood\nsugars were found to be in the 140s to 150s so rarely recieved\ncoverage with humalog. She can restart her rosiglitizone.\n.\n#PT consulted and believed she would benefit from [**Hospital 98**] rehab.\n.\nFEN: diabetic cardiac diet\n.\nPROPHYLAXIS: heparin sc 5000 TID, colace, senna prn\n.\nDaughter's cell is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 82228**]\nCODE: full\n\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\n Formoterol Fumarate 12 mcg Capsule, w/Inhalation Device Sig:\nOne (1)  Inhalation twice a day.\n loratidine  Sig: One (1) 10mg  once a day.\nPolyvinyl Alcohol-Povidone 1.4-0.6 % Dropperette Sig: 1-2 Drops\nOphthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eyes.\n Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\n Rosiglitazone 2 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO once a day.\n Duloxetine 30 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)
