Was\nfound to have 50% left main in [**2169**] and decided on medical\nmanagement. He currently is asymptomatic but recently underwent\nan nuclear perfusion study which\ndemonstrated anteroapical ischemia with an ejection fraction of\n57%. Therefore he was brought for a cardiac cath which now\nshowed 60-70% left main distal stenosis.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.\n3. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with\nnormal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The\nleft ventricular cavity size is normal.\n4. Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild)\nleft ventricular diastolic dysfunction.\n5. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are\nnormal.\n6.There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are\ncomplex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.\n7.There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic\nvalve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.\n8. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial\nmitral regurgitation is seen.\n9.There is an anterior space which most likely represents a\nprominent fat pad.\nPOSTBYPASS:\nThe patient is mainained on low dose phenylephrine infusion &\nV-paced.\nBiventricular function is maintained.

Overall the patient tolerated\nthe procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the\nCVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.\nPOD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and\nbreathing comfortably. The patient was neurologically intact and\nhemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.\nBeta blocker was initiated and titrated up and the patient was\ngently diuresed toward the preoperative weight. CPAP for known\nobstructive sleep apnea was initiated with his home settings.\nThe patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further\nrecovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without\ncomplication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy\nservice for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time\nof discharge on POD #4 he was ambulating freely, the wound was\nhealing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
