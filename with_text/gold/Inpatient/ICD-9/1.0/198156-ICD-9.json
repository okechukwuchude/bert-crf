The\naortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good\nleaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve\nappears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.\n\nPost bypass: Patient is a paced on phenylepherine infusion.\nPreserved biventricular function, LVEF >55%. MR remains trace.\nAortic contours intact. Remaining exam is unchanged. All\nfindings discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.\n  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance\nwith HCFA regulations.\n\nElectronically signed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD, Interpreting\nphysician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2127-4-25**] 13:51\n\n\n??????

All rights reserved.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient was brought to the operating room on [**4-25**]  where he\nunderwent CABGX6 ( left internal mammary artery to left anterior\ndescending artery, saphenous vein sequential grafting to obtuse\nmarginal 1 and 2, saphenous vein sequential grafting to\nposterior left ventricular branch and posterior descending\nartery, saphenous vein graft to diagonal) with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) **]. Please\nrefer to operative report for further surgical details. He was\ntransferred to CVICU in stable condition for recovery and\ninvasive monitoring.\n\nPOD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and\nbreathing comfortably.  He was neurologically intact and\nhemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor\nsupport. Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently\ndiuresed toward the preoperative weight. Mr.[**Known lastname **] was\ntransferred to the step down unit further recovery.  Chest tubes\nand pacing wires were discontinued without complication.\nPhysical therapy was consulted for evaluation of assistance with\nstrength and mobility. He continued to progress and by the time\nof discharge on POD #4 he was ambulating freely, the wound was\nhealing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics. Dr.[**First Name (STitle) **]\ncleared him for discharge to home with VNA services on POD#4.\nAll appropriate follow up instructions were advised.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nNone\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. oxycodone-acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO\nQ4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain.\nDisp:*50 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n2. ranitidine HCl 150 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n3. simvastatin 10 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n4. metoprolol tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n5. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\nDisp:*60 Capsule(s)* Refills:*2*\n6. furosemide 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day for\n7 days.\nDisp:*7 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n7. potassium chloride 10 mEq Tablet Extended Release Sig: Two\n(2) Tablet Extended Release PO once a day for 7 days.\nDisp:*14 Tablet Extended Release(s)* Refills:*0*\n8. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
