Per her parents, on [**2156-8-22**] she had a low grade\ntemperature of 100.0. On [**2156-8-25**]  she had two episodes of\nnonbloody emesis, and she started to have a dry, nonproductive\ncough. Ms. [**Known lastname 85111**] parents also noted that the she had\ndiaphoresis and increased movements. On [**2156-8-26**] they noticed\nthat her left eye, which has a keratograft and tarsorrhaphy,\nbecame red and injected, with a small amount of purulent yellow\ndrainage. Per her parents, she has had eye infections multiple\ntimes but they have resolved with drops. During the last week,\nher rehab reports that she has been arching her back with head\nturning to the left, has had increasing tone in LUE and lower\nextremities, with flexion of the right arm. These episodes last\nabout 30 seconds and don't appear to be in repsonse to anything.\n For the past two weeks she has also had mottling on the lower\nextremities, but this may be connected to their utilization of\nthe tilt table at rehab. At rehab on [**2156-8-28**], she had a\ntemperature of 101, and she may hvae had abdominal tenderness\nper physician's exam (she grimaced with abdominal exam). She was\nsent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED and spiked to 102 while in triage at the\nBED.\n.\nOn arrival to the ED her initial VS were T99.4, HR 122, BP\n122/71, RR 18, Sat 98%. On exam she was noted to have a\nnontender abdomen, a maculopapular rash on her face (which her\nparents said has been going on for weeks) and very cloudy urine.\nNeurosurgery was consulted. Preliminary read of the CT scan of\nher head (which was done with and without contrast at the\nrequest of neurosurgery) did not show any clear focus of\ninfection in her head and was overall not significantly changed\nfrom prior. Labs were notably primarily for a WBC of 11.9\n(79%N), an LDH of 273 (no prior for comparison). Her UA was\nrelatively unremarkable and a CXR appeared to have no evidence\nof a PNA although it was somewhat nondiagnostic.\n.\nNeurosurgery felt that she should be admitted to medicine for\nworkup of fever. They feel it is very unlikely that the cause of\nher fever is her IC shunt given that she has had it for the\nbetter part of a year, however if her workup remains negative\nthey could consider tapping it.\n.\nOn the floor, she was tachycardic to 111, with a Tmax of 99.3\nand BP of 133/69. She was nonverbal and therefore unable to give\nhistory.\n.\nReview of systems:\n(+) Per HPI\n(-) Unable to assess. Parents confirm no diarrhea and no other\nmental status changes. Other than HPI, she is at baseline.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\n1. L craniectomy and cranioplasty\n2. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt\n3. Traumatic Brain Injury\n4. G-tube placement [**2156-1-29**]\n5. Exposure keratopathy and keratitis of the L eye\n6. s/p L tarsorrhaphy\n7. Traumatic optic neuropathy of the left eye\n8.

Fracture of left coracoid process and inferior sternum\n11. L medial malleolus fracture and left tibial plateau\nfracture, s/p ORIF\n12. Minimally displaced comminuted fracture of the L inferior\npubic rami and minimally displaced fracture of the superior\npubic ramus.\n13. R transverse process fracture of L5\n14. Vertical midling sacral fracture\n15. Myositis ossificans of the R proximal quadriceps\n16. B/L pulmonary contusions.\n17. IVC filter placement [**2156-1-22**].\n18. Hepatic laceration\n19. Autonomic dysfunction\n20. S/P L keratograft at Mass Eye & Ear in [**2-4**].\n\nSocial History:\nMs. [**Known lastname 28082**] was a previously healthy, fully functioning woman\nprior to being hit by a drunk driver in [**Location (un) 7349**]. She is a graudate\nof [**University/College 85112**] and was working as an aide for Mayor [**Last Name (un) 41364**]\nprior to her accident. She is currently a resident at [**Hospital1 **]. She has a very supportive family and her parents are\nquite involved in her care.\n\n\nFamily History:\nnon-contributory\n\nPhysical Exam:\nVitals: T: 99.3 BP: 133/69 P: 111 R: 20 O2: 98% on RA\nGeneral: In a vegetative state.

No adenopathy.  The rectum and sigmoid\ncolon are unremarkable.\nUrinary catheter noted within the bladder.\n\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Known lastname 28082**] was admitted to the medicine service for fever of unknown\nsource. She is in a persistent vegetative state at baseline. A\nfull workup for fever remained negative. She was found on\n[**2156-8-31**] to have a generalized seizure. Her oxygen saturation was\nin the 80's at that moment and she was intubated and transferred\nto the ICU. In the ICU she was placed on two AED's (dilantin and\nKeppra). Her Shunt was tapped and adjusted per neurosurgery. One\nof two bottles from the CSF grew out coagulase negative staph.\nWe believe this is a contaminate given the benign nature of the\nCSF profile. Still she was started on empiric antibiotics which\nwere Vancomycin and Ceftazidime. This was written for a 7 day\ncourse and completed. She was subsequently afebrile. She was\nextubated on [**2156-9-2**] and observed in the ICU overnight. There\nwere no acute events. She was transferred to the floor for\nfurther care.\n\nOn the floor her antiepileptic drugs were adjusted to ensure\ncontrol with oral agents. Dilantin was stopped and valproate\nstarted. Keppra was continued. Tube feeds were increased with\ntwo three hour pauses daily to give these medications (hold one\nhour before and two hours after). She had no further seizures on\nthe floor. Occulopalatal myoclonus continued.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMED Sodium Chloride 0.9% Flush 3 mL IV Q8H:PRN line flush\nPeripheral line: Flush with 3 mL Normal Saline every 8 hours and\nPRN.\nMED Acetaminophen 1000 mg NG Q6H:PRN fever\nDo not exceed 4gm per day.\nMED Adderall *NF* (Amphetamine-Dextroamphetamine) 10 mg OGT [**Hospital1 **]\nplease schedule for 0700, 1200\nMED Ipratropium Bromide Neb 1 NEB IH Q6H:PRN wheezing\nMED Docusate Sodium (Liquid) 100 mg NG [**Hospital1 **]\nMED Dantrolene Sodium 75 mg PO TID\nplease give through G tube\nMED Bisacodyl 10 mg PR QOD\nMED Propranolol 30 mg PO/NG TID\nMED Artificial Tear Ointment 1 Appl BOTH EYES HS\nMED Polyethylene Glycol 17 g PO/NG DAILY:PRN constipation\nMED Calcium Carbonate 500 mg PO/NG TID\nMED Vitamin D 800 UNIT PO/NG DAILY\nMED Levalbuterol Neb *NF* 0.63 mg/3 mL Inhalation q2hrs wheezing\n\nMED Senna 1 TAB PO/NG [**Hospital1 **]:PRN constipation\nMED Atomoxetine *NF* 80 mg OGT daily\nMED Amantadine 200 mg PO/NG DAILY\nplease schedule for 0800, 1400\nMED Multivitamins 1 TAB NG DAILY\nMED Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY\nplease give through OGT\nMED Ondansetron 4 mg IV Q8H:PRN nausea\nIV 500 mL NS Bolus 500 ml Over 30 mins\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
