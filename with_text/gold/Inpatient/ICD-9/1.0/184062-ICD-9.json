This was not associated with diaphoresis, chest\npain, palpitations or shortness of breath.  Her symptoms\npersisted so, around 1130pm, she was brought to the ED by her\nfamily.\n.\nOn arrival to the ED, EKG demonstrated ST-elevations in I, aVL.\nShe received aspirin, heparin gtt and SL nitro with some relief\nof her symptoms and was taken to the cath lab.  While in the\ncath lab, she received plavix 300mg and bivalirudin.  Cath\ndemonstrated an occlusion of a small OM branch of LCx so no\nintervention was performed.  The patient remained\nhemodynamically stable after the procedure.  She is being\nadmitted to the CCU for further monitoring.\n.\nOn arrival to the CCU, vital signs were T- 96.1, HR 69, BP\n172/66, RR 21, SaO2- 100% on 2L NC.

Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system\ndemonstrated one vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was\nangiographically-free of any flow-limiting stenoses.  The LAD\nhad a mid\n30-40% lesion involving D1.  D1 itself was noted to have a\n50-60%\nstenosis.  The LCx had an occluded branch before a moderate OM1;\nno AV\ngroove Cx identified.  The RCA was a large vessel that had a\n40-50%\nlesion at the ostium, as well as a 50% lesion distally.\n2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic\nsystolic\narterial pressures, with a central aortic pressure of 135/59,\nmean 66\nmmHg.\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:\n1. One vessel coronary artery disease - lateral STEMI likely due\nto\noccluded small OM branch of LCx.\n2. Systemic systolic arterial normotension.\n\nTTE ([**2168-1-16**]):\nThe left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left\nventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There\nis mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with\nhypokinesis of the basal half of the anterolateral wall. The\nremaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 %). The\nestimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic\nstenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The\nmitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no\nmitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-7**]+) mitral\nregurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery\nsystolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild\nregional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (LCX or Diagonal\ndistribution). Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n89yo female with multiple cardiac risk factors admitted with\nST-elevation MI.\n.\n#.CAD: Patient with ST-elevation MI, found to have occlusion of\nsmall OM branch during cath. No intervention was indicated at\nthe time of the procedure. She was plavix loaded and started on\n75 daily in AM, also started ASA 325mg PO daily, bivalirudin and\nSL nitro. After procedure she was chest pain free but initially\nreported mild left arm/shoulder pain which resolved. Post-cath\necho showed normal left ventricular cavity size with mild\nregional systolic dysfunction (LVEF 55%) c/w CAD (LCX or\nDiagonal distribution) amd mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.\nPatient\ninitially on high-dose atorvastatin; discharged on pravastatin\n80mg daily given lower risk of myalgias. Also started ASA 325\ndaily, losartan 25mg daily, metoprolol 25mg daily and plavix 75\ndaily.\n.\n#.Fever: patient had fever to 100.8 in the 24hrs following cath.\nInitial concern was aspiration PNA given that she was seen\npossibly aspirating food while in CCU. However, CXR WNL. Blood\ncx and urine cx NGTD. Most likely etiology is post-STEMI\ninflammation causing cytokine release resulting in fever, as can\noccur in the natural history of myocardial infarction when no\nintervention occurs.\n.\n#.Hypertension:  Patient's blood pressures ranging from SBP\n130s-160s on admission; on amlodipine and losartan at home.\nAmlodipine was discontinued, losartan was continued and\nmetoprolol also added in the post-MI setting.\n.\n#. Hyperlipidemia- Lipid panel from [**12/2167**] demonstrated TC 210,\nHDL 44, LDL 148, TG 90. Pt treated with atorvastatin 80mg PO\ndaily while in hospital, but switched back to pravastatin 80mg\nPO daily on discharge due to lower risk of statin myopathy.\n.\n#.DM- On metformin 500mg daily at home. Last A1c- 6.6%.\nPatient's home metformin was held in the setting of recent\ncardiac cath and she was treated with ISS. Restarted metformin\non discharge.\n.\n#.Rheumatoid arthritis- continued home dose of methotrexate +\nacetaminophen PRN.\n.\n#.Asthma- continued home fluticasone but held albuterol in the\nsetting of recent MI.\n.\n#.Osteoporosis- continued home calcium and vitamin D.\n.\n# Pulmonary nodule: CXR showed incidental right upper lung\nopacity approximately 11 x 7 mm in diameter, slightly increased\nin size since previous study. Recommend outpatient CT chest to\nfurther evaluate.\n- outpatient chest CT for further evaluation\n.\n================================================\nTRANSITION OF CARE:\n-CXR showed incidental RUL opacity, ~11x7cm diameter, slightly\nincreased in size since previous study.

In the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] EKG was completed and it indicated\nthat you had a Myocardial Infacrtion (MI), also known as a heart\nattack. You were then taken to the cardiac catherization lab and\na blockage of a small OM branch of the left circumflex artery\nwas seen. However, this artery was very small and no\ninterventions were indicated at that time. Your heart rate and\nblood pressure were stable, but you were taken to the Cardiac\nIntensive Unit (CCU) for further monitoring. An echocardiogram\nwas also completed, which showed that your heart function is\nessentially normal following the heart attack. You had a\nlow-grade fever, but urine and blood cultures were all negative\nand your chest xray did not indicate a pneumonia, your fever\nresolved, and you did not need any antibiotics. You were\ntransferred to the cardiac step down unit, where you continued\nto progress, even doing some work with Physical Therapy. Today,\nyou are ready to go home with your children and VNA (visiting\nnurses) will come to help with your care as you recover at home.\n\n\nWe made the following changes to your medicines:\n1. INCREASE the pravastatin to 80 mg daily to lower your\ncholesterol\n2. INCREASE the Aspirin to 325 mg daily to protect your heart\nand decrease your risk of blood clots.\n3. ADD a new blood pressure medication, Metoprolol Succinante\n25mg daily, and stop an old one, Amlopidine, because Metoprolol\nbetter protects your heart after a heart attack.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nName: [**Last Name (LF) 67691**],[**First Name3 (LF) **]\nLocation: [**Location (un) 2274**] [**Location (un) **], Primary Care\nAddress: [**Location (un) **], [**Location (un) **],[**Numeric Identifier 2260**]\nPhone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2261**]\nAppt:  Appt:  Friday, [**1-22**] at 11:40am\n\nName: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2563**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29819**], NP\nLocation: [**Location (un) 2274**] [**Location (un) **], Cardiology\nAddress: [**Location (un) **], [**Location (un) **],[**Numeric Identifier 718**] [**Location (un) 551**]\nPhone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2258**]\nAppt:  Monday, [**2-1**] at 10:40am\n\n\n\n"
