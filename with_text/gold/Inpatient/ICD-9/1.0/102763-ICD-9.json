Request for\n internalization of the PTBD.\n\n ANESTHESIA:  Monitored general anesthesia.\n\n 1% buffered lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.\n\n CLINICIANS:  Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 171**] [**Name (STitle) 172**], [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 147**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 148**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1166**] performed the\n procedure.  The attending, Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 1166**] performed the SMA pseudoaneurysm\n thrombin injection under ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 148**], the\n second attending participated and performed the biliary drainage\n internalization.\n\n PROCEDURE:\n 1.  Ultrasound-guided thrombin injection into the residual SMA pseudoaneurysm.\n 2.  Placement of a modified internal-external PTBD drainage catheter.\n\n PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  A written informed consent was obtained explaining the\n risks and benefits of the procedure.  The patient was brought to the\n angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table.  The anesthesiology\n service provided general anesthesia.  A preprocedure timeout and huddle was\n performed.  The abdomen was prepped and draped including the indwelling\n catheter in the usual sterile fashion.\n\n Pseudoaneurysm Thrombin Injection:Under continuous ultrasound guidance, the\n residual sac of the SMA pseudoaneurysm was accessed percutaneously using a\n 22-gauge AccuStick needle.  The intra-sac location of the needle was confirmed\n by injecting dilute contrast and also on color doppler.  Following this, under\n continuous ultrasound guidance, thrombin was injected until there was a\n satisfactory stasis and nonvisualization of flow.  Post-thrombin injection,\n Doppler examination of the adjacent vessels was performed to confirm preserved\n patency.No significant residual sac was seen.\n\n Internalisation of Biliary catheter:Attention was then directed for\n internalization of the indwelling external PTBD.  Dilute contrast was injected\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2124-4-13**] 10:03 AM\n BILIARY STENT                                                   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 56344**]\n Reason: Needs stent advancement past obstruction\n Admitting Diagnosis: PANCREATIC MASS\n  Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 35\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n through the indwelling external tube which demonstrated the pigtail within the\n confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts.

A\n long 5 French catheter was then advanced over the wire to cannulate the CBD\n distally near the site of stricture.  The [**Last Name (un) 52**] wire was then exchanged for\n a regular Glidewire which in combination with a Kumpe's catheter was used to\n cannulate and navigate through the region of the CBD stenosis and advanced\n further into the fourth part of the duodenum.   The wire was exchanged for a\n [**Last Name (un) 52**] wire and the Kumpe catheter was removed.  Over the [**Last Name (un) 52**] wire, an 8\n French Cook's biliary drainage catheter with extra side holes was placed with\n distal tip in the third part of the duodenum .\n\n FINDINGS:\n 1.

More laterally, there is old contrast\n noted from prior injection.\n 3.  Tubogram through the indwelling catheter demonstrating the pigtail within\n the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts with no intrahepatic\n biliary radicle dilatation.  Stricture is noted at the lower end of the CBD.\n 4.  Scout images with wire and catheter demonstrating extrinsic impression on\n the CBD and the second and proximal third part of the duodenum.\n 5.  Final scout image demonstrating optimal position of the new internal-\n external drainage with pigtail formed beyond the level of the compression in\n the junction of the third and fourth part.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 754**],\n the attending radiologist, was present and supervising throughout.\n\n ANESTHESIA:  Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of\n 200 mcg of fentanyl and 4 mg of Versed throughout the total intra-service time\n of 40 minutes during which patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously\n monitored.  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine and topical lidocaine gel.\n\n PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  An informed written consent was obtained after\n explaining the procedure, benefits, alternatives and risks involved.  The\n patient was brought to angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging\n table.  The right upper quadrant including the existing right biliary catheter\n were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Preprocedure huddle and\n timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 51**] protocol.\n\n An initial scout image of the right upper quadrant was obtained demonstrating\n the existing biliary catheter to have been pulled back and kinked in the\n peritoneal cavity.  Contrast injection through the catheter confirmed moderate\n dilatation of CBD and main intrahepatic bile ducts.  It also demonstrated\n leakage of contrast into the peritoneal cavity and no drainage was noted into\n the duodenum.  The catheter was cut distal to the hub and removed over a\n [**Last Name (un) 52**] wire.  The [**Last Name (un) 52**] wire was advanced further into the proximal jejunum\n using a 5 French Kumpe catheter and was exchanged for a Super Stiff Amplatz\n wire.  Then a 10 French NU stent, modified by cutting side holes proximal and\n distal to the renal pigtail and by cutting off the distal pigtail was placed\n through a 10 French peel-away sheath and advanced into the duodenum.  The\n peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed.  The pigtail of the catheter\n was formed in the duodenum, distal to the ampulla and locked.  Contrast\n injection through the catheter confirmed satisfactory position and free\n drainage through the catheter into the duodenum.  The catheter was locked and\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2124-4-19**] 2:27 PM\n BILIARY CATH CHECK                                              Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 56353**]\n Reason: PTC catheter is kinked at entrance into the peritoneum, plea\n Admitting Diagnosis: PANCREATIC MASS\n  Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 30\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n secured to the skin with 0 silk sutures.

The micropuncture sheath was removed and\n a 5 French vascular sheath was then advanced into the brachial artery.  An\n arteriogram was performed demonstrating satisfactory location of the brachial\n artery sheath.  Using a combination of a 5 French vertebral catheter and a\n 0.035 angled Glidewire, the superior mesenteric artery was selected.  An\n angiogram was performed.

His pain was similar to\nprevious episodes of alcohol-induced pancreatitis.  He\ncomplained of dark urine, acholic stools, and a 15-pound weight\nloss over 6 weeks.  A CT scan performed at the outside hospital\nshowed a large SMA branch pseudoaneurysm, compressing the CBD.\nHe was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and\nmanagement.\n\nPast Medical History:\nPMH: laryngeal cancer s/p XRT, hypertension, pancreatitis, TB as\na child\n\nPSH: left knee fracture repair ([**2080**]), excision TB mass from\nmandible ([**2077**]), drainage of purulent maxillary sinus\n\nSocial History:\nSmokes 2 ppd for many years.\nH/O 20-30 beers per week, states 1 per week for the past 4\nmonths.\n\nFamily History:\nNon-contributory.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nVitals: T 98.4, P 84, BP 160/82, RR 20, O2 97RA\nGen: AO, NAD, pleasant; obvious jaundice\nHEENT: normocephalic, raspy voice, no LAD; CN II-XII intact, +\nscleral icterus\nChest: CTAB, no wheeze/rhonchi/rales\nCV: RRR, no r/m/g; distal pulses palp\nABD: +BS, S/ND; tender bilateral LQ; RUQ minimally tender with\nhepatomegally 5cm below costal margin; not peritoneal, no fluid\nwave\nExt: no edema, gross NVI; PT/DP palp; no asterixis.\n\nPertinent Results:\nDue to length of hospital stay, please see OMR for specific\nlaboratory values.\n\nAdmission labs:\nWBC-7.2 RBC-4.22* Hgb-13.7* Hct-38.9* MCV-92 MCH-32.4*\nMCHC-35.1* RDW-14.0 Plt Ct-231\nPT-18.9* PTT-25.4 INR(PT)-1.7*\nGlucose-126* UreaN-10 Creat-0.8 Na-133 K-3.6 Cl-97 HCO3-29\nAnGap-11\nALT-117* AST-78* AlkPhos-712* Amylase-324* TotBili-15.7*\nLipase-352*\n\nDischarge labs:\nWBC-7.0 RBC-2.84* Hgb-9.3* Hct-27.4* MCV-97 MCH-32.7* MCHC-33.9\nRDW-16.1* Plt Ct-416\nGlucose-95 UreaN-13 Creat-0.6 Na-135 K-4.4 Cl-103 HCO3-27\nAnGap-9\nALT-85* AST-71* AlkPhos-544* TotBili-2.8*\nLipase-29\n\nPertinent Laboratory Trends (admission->discharge)\nHematocrit:\n3\n8\n.\n9\n-\n3\n2\n.\n4\n-30.1-25.5-30.6-26.8-31-21.5-28.8-20.9-36.5-22.5-30.2-26-29-27.7\nTotal bilirubin:\n15.7-17.6-10.7-12.1-9.8-14.8-10.2-12.1-7.3-12-5.6-2.8\n\nESCHERICHIA COLI\n                             |\nAMPICILLIN------------     4 S\nAMPICILLIN/SULBACTAM--   <=2 S\nCEFAZOLIN-------------   <=4 S\nCEFEPIME--------------   <=1 S\nCEFTAZIDIME-----------   <=1 S\nCEFTRIAXONE-----------   <=1 S\nCIPROFLOXACIN---------<=0.25 S\nGENTAMICIN------------   <=1 S\nMEROPENEM-------------<=0.25 S\nPIPERACILLIN/TAZO-----   <=4 S\nTOBRAMYCIN------------   <=1 S\nTRIMETHOPRIM/SULFA----   <=1 S\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname 96679**] was admitted to the West 2a surgical service for\nevaluation and management of his biliary obstruction and SMA\nbranch pseudoaneurysm.  His hospital course was very\ncomplicated, involving multiple vascular and interventional\nradiology procedures, as well as multiple GI bleeds and ICU\ntransfers.  He was ultimately discharged home on hospital day\n25.  Vascular surgery, gastroenterology, and interventional\nradiology were all consulted and were intimately involved in his\ncare.\n\nEvents:\n*HD1 - Vascular surgery consulted for assistance in management.\nTaken to endovascular suite for angiography and attempted\ndefinitive management.  Unsuccessful due to location and risk of\ndamage to jejunal blood supply with occlusion.\n*HD3 - Percutaneous transhepatic cholecystostomy tube placed by\ninterventional radiology for biliary decompression.\n*HD4 - First ultrasound guided thrombin injection into\npseudoaneurysm by IR.\n*HD5 - Second thrombin injection, PTC internalized.\n*HD6 - Follow-up ultrasound showed 99% thrombosis of\npseudoaneurysm.\n*HD7 - 4-unit GI bleed per rectum; no source identified on CTA;\nresuscitated in the ICU without further bleeding\n*HD9 - PTC exchanged by IR for larger catheter\n*HD10 - Febrile to 101.7, blood cultures and bile cultures grew\nE. coli; zosyn started\n*HD11 - PTC exchanged due to kinking of catheter\n*HD12 - 5-unit GI bleed per rectum; transferred to ICU for\nresuscitation; EGD showed active bleeding through ampulla;\nobvious blood in PTC drain; CTA showed no extravasation and\npartial reconstitution of the pseudoaneurysm\n*HD16 - 5-unit melenic/bloody stool and bloody PTC drain output;\ntransferred to ICU\n*HD17 - Pseudoaneurysm coil-embolized x2 by IR\n*HD18 - Left brachial artery thrombectomy and repair by vascular\nsurgery\n*HD22 - Medium melenic stool, no change in hematocrit\n\nNEURO: Mr. [**Known lastname 96680**] mental status remained intact throughout\nhis hospital stay.  His pain was well-controlled with iv and\noral pain medications.\n\nCV:  He was generally hypertensive on the floor, requiring\nmultiple agents to keep his bp below 140/100.  Each time he\nbled, his pressure dropped to 80's/40's, and responded quickly\nto fluids.  During his first ICU admission, he needed a nitro\ndrip to control his hypertension.  He was stabilized on a\nregimen of amlodipine and clonidine, on which he was discharged.\n\nRESP: His respiratory status remained stable throughout his\nadmission.  Incentive spirometry was encouraged.\n\nFEN: Mr. [**Known lastname 96679**] was kept NPO until his pseudoaneurysm and\nbleeding were stabilized.  He was given TPN for nutrition.  Once\nstable, he was advanced to a regular diet, which he tolerated\nwell.\n\nGI: Mr. [**Known lastname 96679**] had several large GI bleeds during his\nadmission.  After investigation, these appear to be due to\nhemobilia from biliary instrumentation.  He had several CTA's,\nnone of which demonstrated a bleeding source.  An upper\nendoscopy showed fresh blood from the ampulla, as well as\nsignificant old blood in the duodenum.  He had a PTC drain\nplaced for biliary decompression, which was kept to drainage\nuntil his bleeding stopped and his bilirubin began to decrease.\nThe PTC was internalized and he did not have further obstructive\nsymptoms.  His admission bilirubin was 17.6, and had decreased\nto 2.8 at the time of discharge.  He will go home with his PTC\ncapped.\n\nHEME:  He had several GI bleeds.  He received a total of 14\nunits of PRBC's and 3 units of FFP.  His hematocrit on discharge\nwas stable at 27.7.  He developed a left radial artery occlusion\nafter an access procedure, and was taken to the operating room\nwith vascular surgery for a left brachial artery thrombectomy\nand repair.\n\nID: He became bacteremic with E. coli after biliary\ninstrumentation, and was given a course of zosyn, which he\ncompleted in-house.\n\nPROPHYLAXIS: He was kept on protomix and venodyne boots.\nIncentive spirometry and early ambulation were encouraged.  He\nwas not given heparin subcutaneously due to his bleeding.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nxanax 0.5mg QID\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. alprazolam 0.25 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO QID (4 times\na day) as needed for anxiety.\n2. hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4\nhours) as needed for pain.\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n3. clonidine 0.1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a\nday).\nDisp:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n4. amlodipine 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n5. pantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)

Requires PTC for decompression.\n\n CLINICIANS:  Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1788**] [**Name (STitle) 1169**], [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 171**] [**Last Name (un) 172**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1562**] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1617**] [**Doctor Last Name 291**] performed the\n procedure.  The attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 291**], was present and supervising during the\n entire procedure.\n\n The anesthesia team provided the general anesthesia and monitored the\n patient's hemodynamic parameters throughout the procedure.  1% buffered\n lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.\n\n PROCEDURE:  A written informed consent was obtained explaining the risks and\n benefits of the procedure.  The patient was brought to the angiography suite\n and placed supine on the imaging table.  The right side of the abdomen was\n prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The anesthesia service\n provided general anesthesia after intubating the patient.\n\n Using fluoroscopic and ultrasound guidance, a peripheral right posterior bile\n duct was accessed using AccuStick needle.  Dilute contrast was injected to\n confirm the intraductal location of the tip of the needle.  A 0.016 headliner\n wire was advanced through the needle and coiled in the duct over which the\n needle was removed and exchanged for AccuStick sheath.  After removing the\n inner of the AccuStick sheath, contrast was injected to opacify the biliary\n ductal system, which demonstrated moderate dilatation of the CBD and\n intrahepatic ducts.  The CBD does not appear to drain antegrade into the\n duodenum.  Smooth narrowing is seen at its mid to terminal portion.  This is\n due to extrinsic compression by the pseudoaneurysm.  No filling defects are\n noted.  A stiff 0.035 wire was then advanced through the AccuStick sheath and\n the sheath was removed.  An 8-French biliary drainage catheter was then\n advanced over the wire and pigtailed within the confluence of the hepatic\n ducts.  Dilute contrast was injected to position the side holes within the\n intraductal system.  The patient withstood the procedure well and had no\n immediate complications.  The catheter was connected to a bag externally.  It\n was secured to the skin with 0 silk suture and stat-locked.  The patient was\n shifted to the PACU in stable condition.\n\n IMPRESSION:  Uncomplicated percutaneous transhepatic biliary cholangiogram and\n drainage via a right posterior duct.  An 8 French external drain is placed\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2124-4-11**] 6:19 PM\n PTBD                                                            Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 58488**]\n Reason: pls place PTC to decompress biliary tree\n Admitting Diagnosis: PANCREATIC MASS\n  Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 25\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n which was connected to a bag for drainage.\n\n"
