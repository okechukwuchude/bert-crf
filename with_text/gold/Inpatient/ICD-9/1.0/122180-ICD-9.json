No\ncontrast was administered. Multiplanar reformatted images were\ngenerated.\nFINDINGS: There is an extensive amount of high-density material\ntracking\naround the cerebellum, as well as through the basilar cisterns.\nOverall, this is consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage. There\nis no obvious area of greatest density to indicate a source for\nthe bleeding. Hyperdense material also layers dependently within\nthe occipital horns of the lateral ventricles, and collects in\nthe third and fourth ventricles. Lateral ventricles are not\nenlarged, although comparison with the prior study is not\npossible at the time of dictation. However, there is no large\nventricular outlet obstruction. High-density material also\nlayers along the tentorium cerebelli. There are no other foci of\nintracranial hemorrhage. There is no edema, shift of normally\nmidline structures or evidence of major vascular territorial\ninfarct. There is no large mass effect associated with\nintraventricular and subarachnoid bleeding. There is no other\nevidence of herniation. There is no fracture. Mastoid air cells\nare well aerated. There is fluid within scattered ethmoid air\ncells, but the sphenoid, maxillary and frontal air cells are\nwell aerated.\nIMPRESSIONS:\n1. Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage along the base of the brain,\nand\ncollecting within the ventricles, predominantly within the third\nand fourth ventricles, but also layering dependently in the\nlateral ventricles. No evidence of outlet obstruction at this\ntime, although a comparison with prior CT would be useful to\ndetermine interval change. No mass effect or herniation at this\ntime.\n2. No other foci of hemorrhage.\n3. Opacification of scattered ethmoid air cells.\n\nCTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS [**2107-5-29**] 2:36 PM\nSCAN FINDINGS: Non-contrast CT of the head demonstrates diffuse\ncerebral\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage including blood products within the\nlateral\nventricles, third ventricles and filling the fourth ventricle\nextending\nthrough the foramen of Luschka with subarachnoid hemorrhage in\nthe right\nperimesencephalic cistern. There is no significant shift of\nmidline\nstructures.\nCTA OF THE HEAD: CTA of the head demonstrates a tiny 2.5-mm\noutpouching at\nthe origin of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery\nsuggestive of a tiny aneurysm. 2.5 mm indicates the patent\nlumen. The location of this\naneurysm would be consistent with the pattern of subarachnoid\nhemorrhage.\nThe right vertebral artery terminates in the PICA. The remaining\nintracranial circulation demonstrates no evidence of\nhemodynamically significant stenosis, aneurysm or occlusion. The\nright vertebral artery, basilar artery as well as the anterior\ncirculation is intact. Note is made of bilateral ventriculostomy\ncatheters in the frontal lobes terminating within the lateral\nventricles.\nIMPRESSION:\nDiffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage including right\nperimesencephalic cistern\nand fourth intraventricular hemorrhage. 2.5 mm likely tiny\naneurysm at the origin of the right posterior inferior\ncerebellar artery. Further evaluation with cerebral angiography\nis recommended, as clinically relevant.\n\nECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT [**2107-5-30**] at 9:45:40 AM\nConclusions:\nThe left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is\nseen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses\nand cavity size are normal. There is moderate global left\nventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35%). No masses or thrombi are\nseen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an\nincreased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There\nis no ventricular septal defect. The diameters of aorta at the\nsinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve\nleaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not\npresent. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve\nleaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is\nseen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There\nis borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is\nno pericardial effusion.\n\nECG Study [**2107-5-30**]  10:08:18 AM\nSinus rhythm\nNonspecific diffuse ST-T changes.

Unchanged appearance of the right posterior inferior\ncerebellar artery\nterritory infarction.\n\n2. 2 mm aneurysm at the origin of the right posterior inferior\ncerebellar\nartery is again seen. The posterior inferior cerebellar artery\nremains\npatent.\n\n3. Unchanged subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage\n\nTTE (Complete) Done [**2107-6-13**] at 2:03:19 PM\nThe left atrium is elongated. No left atrial mass/thrombus seen\n(best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). Left\nventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global\nsystolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of\naorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic\nstenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The\nmitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no\nmitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.\nModerate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic\npulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting\npulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial\neffusion.\n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-5-30**], the\nestimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is slightly higher\nand the severity of mitral regurgitation and tricuspid\nregurgitation is slightly higher. No cardiac source of embolism\nidentified.\n\nCTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of [**2107-6-13**] 11:51\n1.

The arteriogram demonstrated mild vasospasm. The\naneurysm\nappeared well clipped. 5 mg of Verapamil were given IV via slow\ninfusion,\nsecondary to the vasospasm. No new aneurysms, regions of\nflow-limiting\nstenosis or occlusions were identified.\n\nThe left internal carotid artery arteriogram demonstrated\nminimal vasospasm in the left lenticulostriate and MCA branches.\nNo new aneurysm is identified. 5mg of Verapamil were infused via\nslow infusion.\n\nThe left vertebral artery arteriogram demonstrated minimal\nvasospasm. No new aneurysms are identified. 5 mg of Verapamil\nwere infused via slow infusion.\n\nA right common carotid artery arteriogram was performed\nsecondary to moderate plaque at the origin of the right internal\ncarotid artery. Mild vasospasm was noted. 5 mg of Verapamil were\ninfused IV via slow infusion.\n\nModerate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of\nFentanyl\nthroughout the total intraservice time of 1 hour and 15 minutes\nduring which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were\ncontinuously monitored.\n\nCHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2107-6-23**] 4:01 AM\nSmall bilateral pleural effusions and mild pulmonary edema have\nimproved since [**6-21**]. Heart size is top normal. Leftward\nmediastinal shift and\nopacification at the left lung base suggest left lower lobe\ncollapse, present since at least [**6-6**]. Tracheostomy tube in\nstandard placement. No\npneumothorax.\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nPt was received to the ED from OSH after c/o headache and neck\npain at home.  Accorrding to EMS records she required\nresucitation.  IN the ED she was severly hypotensive and\nrequired fluid resucitation.\n\nCT scan reveled SAH with IVH and HCP.  She was taken emergently\nto the OR for placment of bilateral EVD's.  After the OR she had\nan emergent CTA of the brain which did not reveal a source of\nthe SAH.\n\nShe was transfered to the SICU and monitored closely. Nimodipine\nand dilantin were started.  Cardilogy consult was initiated in\nthe ED for elevated troponins.  She underwent a TTE which the\nresults are in the results section of this summary.\n\nA Cerebral angiogram was performed on [**2107-5-31**].  It revealed a\nRight PICA aneurysm.\nMRI did not show any infarcts.  Pt was medically managed as she\nwas not able to be coiled.  A decision was made monitor her exam\nfor a few more days to see if she improved before considering an\nopen craniotomy.\n\nOn [**6-5**] pt began opening eys and able to stick tongue out on\ncommand. On [**6-7**] she began withdrawing her lower extremities to\nstimulation and nodding head to simple questions. Her L EVD was\ndc'd without difficulty.\n\nHer neurological exam vastly improved to following commands by\nnodding head appropriately to questions correctly and lifting\nall extremeties off the bed to command. She received a trach\nplaced on [**6-7**]. She underwent an attempted coiling on [**6-10**] of\nher right vertebral artery but it was unable to be accessed.\n\nOn [**6-12**], patient had a right cerbellar infact that was not\npreviously seen on CT. Neuro suspected that the infarct may have\noccluded the PICA and the aneurysm. Patient mouthing words, A&O\nx3, moves all extremites to command. [**6-13**], CTA showed patency of\nPICA and planning for open coiling or clipping of PICA aneurysm\nstarted. CTA will be repeated on [**6-15**] to recheck patency of\nPICA. EVD \"fell\" out and stat CT showed stable SAH.\n\nOn [**6-15**], patient A&O x3 and following commands. Her repeat head\nCT shows slight increase in lateral ventricle size, but stable.\nPatient will be sent to OR for open clipping of PICA aneurysm.\n\nOn [**6-16**] patient was brought to the OR where she underwent a\nclipping of her R pica aneurysm. She tolerated the procedure\nwell and her post-op head CT show no new hemorrhage however she\ndid have further evolution or R cerebellar infarct.\n\nOn [**6-17**], angiogram showed good clip placement with mild\nvasospasm. She was able to still follow commands and open her\neyes spontaneoulsy. She was not moving her upper extremities.\nShe was also placed on nimodipine 60mg Q4H for vasospasm.\n\nOn the 23rd and 24th, patient's physical exam improved, she was\nable to move both upper and lower extremities, but UE<LE. Her\nnimodipine was discontinued.\n\nPatient's physical exam showed she was following commands,\nmouthing words, and moving lower extremities. She will be\ndischarged to a rehab facility with ventilator.\n\nMedications on Admission:\ndiovan, vytorin 10/40, metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], asa 325 daily, MVI,\nglucosoamine, calcium.\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
