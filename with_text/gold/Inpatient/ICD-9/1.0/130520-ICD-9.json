Please evaluate anatomy and to\n discontinue tube if possible.\n\n PHYSICIAN:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], M.D., attending, was present and supervising.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 60**]\n [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 61**], M.D., fellow, was performing the procedure.\n\n FLUOROSCOPY TIME:  1.4 minutes.\n\n MEDICATIONS:  Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of\n Versed totaling 2 mg throughout the total intraservice time of 40 minutes,\n during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored.\n Patient remained in control with her PCA device.\n\n PROCEDURES:  Gravity cholangiogram via indwelling right lobe biliary drain.\n Removal of drain.\n\n PROCEDURE DETAILS:  Informed consent was obtained from the patient.  She was\n positioned supine on the angiography table.  The area was prepped and draped\n in sterile fashion.  Appropriate timeout was performed.  Fluoroscopy was used\n intermittently.\n\n With gravity, contrast was dripped into the indwelling drain.  This showed\n adequate flow through the choledochoduodenostomy into the duodenum.  There was\n no appreciable flow through the ampulla.  The drain was then pulled back\n slightly and more contrast was administered.  No intrahepatic strictures were\n evident.  There was free flow of contrast into the bowel.  The drain was then\n removed.  Pressure was held for about 15 minutes until there was no longer\n leaking along the tract.  A pressure dressing was applied.  Patient left the\n department in stable condition without any immediate complication.\n\n FINDINGS:  Patent choledochoduodenostomy tract with free flow from the upper\n common bile duct into the duodenum.  The ampulla appears to be fully\n obstructed.  There was no appreciable flow along this anatomic pathway, though\n this is likely just higher resistance than the bypass.  No intrahepatic\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2194-8-20**] 11:48 AM\n BILIARY CATH CHECK                                              Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 2905**]\n Reason: Please evaluate anatomy via drain study of PTBD.\n Admitting Diagnosis: CHRONIC DISTAL COMMON BILE DUCT/SDA\n  Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 20\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n strictures identified.

On [**2194-8-14**], the patient underwent\nthe following procedure:\n1. Extensive lysis of adhesions.\n2. Open cholecystectomy with common bile duct exploration.\n3. Partial wedge hepatectomy.\n4. Choledochoduodenostomy biliary bypass.\n\nThis procedure went well without complication (reader referred\nto the Operative Note for details). After her operation, the\npatient was admitted to the ICU NPO, on IV fluids, on a 1-day\ncourse of antibiotics, with a foley catheter, JP drain, PTBD,\nand NGT in place.  She remained intubated, on a ventillator, and\nwas hemodynamically stable.\n\nOn POD#1, the patient was successfully extubated, and placed on\na ketamine drip for pain control. Later that day, the ketamine\ndrip was discontinued, and an epidural was placed for pain\ncontrol. For a short period (approximately 1 hour) after placing\nthe epidural, the patient required a small dose of pressor\nsupport to maintain her blood pressures. Thereafter, she no\nlonger required this, and tolerated the epidural well. Her\ndrains were maintained. She remained NPO, with all her drains\nand tubes still in place.\n\nOn POD#2, the patient was transfused 2 units of PRBC. Her\nepidural and drains/tubes were maintained. She was out of bed to\nchair.\n\nOn POD#3, she was well enough to be transferred out of the ICU,\nand onto the general surgical floor. She remained NPO, with JP,\nPTBD, NGT and foley in place, as well as the epidural continued\nfor pain control.\n\nOn POD#5, her NGT was clamped, and epidural and all other drains\nwere maintained. On this day, due to some concern about erythema\naround her incision, she was stared on IV cefazolin. Her\nepidural was removed, and she was transitioned to a PCA for pain\ncontrol, which she tolerated well. Her foley was removed and she\nurinated independently. Later in the day, her NGT was removed,\nand she was permitted to have clear liquids, which she tolerated\nvery well.\n\nOn POD#6, her PTBD had a drain study performed on it, and upon\nsatisfactory results (reader referred to \"Pertinent Results\")\nthe drain was removed. Additionally, her JP drain was\ndiscontinued. Due to some concern for nausea, she was made NPO.\nHowever, upon feeling much better in the evening, she was put\nback on clear liquids, and then a regular diet. She tolerated\nthis very well.\n\nOn POD#7, due to a marked improvement in the appearance of her\nincision, her IV cefazolin was discontinued. Her epidural was\nremoved, and she was transitioned to oral pain medications,\nwhich she tolerated well. She was seen by Physical Therapy, and\nambulated mutiple times per day.\n\nShe continued to progress well. On POD#9, she was noted to spike\na fever to 102.4, upon which a fever workup was initiated, and\nall results were negative for any infectious process. A second\nfever on POD#10 prompted ultrasounds of the LEs and RUQ, both of\nwhich were unconcerning as well. Thereafter, the patient had no\nmore fevers. She continued to feel well, with good pain control,\nambulating multiple times per day, and tolerating regular diet.\nHer staples were removed on POD#10 and steri strips were placed.\n\n\nThe patient remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;\nvital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary toilet,\nearly ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged\nthroughout hospitalization. Electrolytes were routinely\nfollowed, and repleted when necessary. The patient's white blood\ncount and fever curves were closely watched for signs of\ninfection. Wound care was performed regularly and thoroughly.\nThe patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout his stay;\ninsulin dosing was adjusted accordingly. The patient received\nsubcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this\nstay; was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as\npossible.\n\nAt the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile\nwith stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular\ndiet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well\ncontrolled.  The patient received discharge teaching and\nfollow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and\nagreement with the discharge plan.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nmethadone 20''', oxycodone 30''', losartan 50', ibuprofen  600'\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
