Biopsy\nshowed well-to-moderately differentiated HCC. Further imaging\nstudies have been limited due to history of contrast nephropathy\nrequiring hydration (which is further limited by cardiac\nconcerns).  Discussions of chemoembolization, RFA-sorafenib, ans\nsorafenib systemic chemo.\n.\nOTHER PMH:\n- HCV cirrhosis, viral load 10/11/[**2111**]=9,619,847 IU/mL.

You were also started\non bacitracin/polymyxin ointment for a right-eye conjunctivitis.\n\nActive Diagnoses:\n# Somnolence: Ddx included hepatic encephelopathy vs. uremia vs.\nhypercarbia vs. medication effect (was on gabapentin, baclofen,\nMSContin, oxycodone) vs. hypoventilation/OSA. Less likely\netiologies include CVA, more likely hemispheric than brainstem.\nPatient has some degree of cirrhosis, but normal EGD in [**Month (only) 547**]\n[**2112**], no peripheral stigmata on exam, and synthetic function not\nterribly depressed (normal coags, though admission albumin 2.5).\nRenal function steadily deteriorating and BUN climbing so this\ncould likely be a contributing etiology. TSH wnl. Infection also\nin ddx, though afebrile, WBC not high at this time, UA negative,\nand has been on abx for cellulitis.  We increased the frequency\nof lactulose to treat potential hepatic encephelopathy,\ntitrating to [**4-8**] BM/day.  He was encouraged to use BIPAP\novernight for obesity hypoventilation in case hypercapnia was\ncontributing to his somnolence, but this seems more chronic in\nnature.  He was cultured to rule out toxic/metabolic causes of\nencephalopathy.  Cultures were negative.  Cr increased despite\noctreotide, midodrine and pt became volume overloaded, leading\nto need for dialysis.  Dialysis was initiated and pt's MS\nimproved to baseline indicating uremia was likely contributing\nto AMS.  However around the same time pt was also started on\nlactulose, so could have had a level of HE.  Pt's hypoxic\nepisodes could have been contributory to AMS as well.\n\n# Hypoxemia: A-a gradient <10 making hypoxemia is suggestive of\nhypoventilation, likely secondary to obesity\nhypoventilation/sleep apnea. Hypercarbia appears to be somewhat\nchronic in nature given pH of 7.34 and pCO2 of 54 (if acute\nchange, would expect pH of 7.28 or so). Pt denies recent\nworsening of cough or dyspnea. Has been afebrile.  He was\nencouraged to use BIPAP while asleep for obesity\nhypoventilation.  A CXR was obtained to assess for any acute\nprocess. He was admitted to MICU for worsening respiratory\ndistress, given his anasarca pulmonary edema was the focared\ndiagnosis, though aspiration pneumonitis and PNA were also\nconsidered. He was treated with Vancomycin/Zosyn empirically and\nhe received bedside hemodialysis to remove excess fluid. In MICU\nhis repiratory status improved with HD, empiric therapy and\npatient began auto-diuresing.  On floor was continued on UF 3x\nweekly and his sats remained in the high 90s.\n\n# Anasarca- Likely secondary to hypoalbuminemia from cirrhotic\ndisease and progressive renal failure (renal protein wasting\nthough not nephrotic range proteinuria). Also, was off of lasix\nand spironolactone since prior discharge on [**8-30**] and was just\nrestarted on [**9-16**] (40 mg IV) and [**9-18**] (60 mg) w/ poor response.\nHas become oliguric in response to recent lasix challenges. Per\nhepatology consult on the day of ICU transfer, patient appears\nto have hepatorenal syndrome, so he was given albumin 25 q8h and\ndiuresis was held. He received albumin before arriving to MICU\nand in MICU was started on midodrine/ocreotide for possible\nhepatorenal syndome. Hepatology and renal followed in MICU and\nhe received bedside HD.  Pt was then transitioned to UF as\nmentioned above.  Anasarca resolved and pt's creatine improved\nto 1.8 on discharge.  He will be set up for outpatient UF 3x\nweekly.\n\n# [**Last Name (un) **]: History of CKD w/ baseline creatinine around 1.6. Recent\nhistory of contrast nephropathy with creatinine as high as 3.7.\nCurrently rising from 1.6 on admission to 2.6 today. Likely\nsecondary to poor forward flow in setting of intravascular\ndepletion with a component of hepatorenal syndrome. Gave albumin\nand held diuresis in the setting of likely hepatorenal syndrome.\nAs above, he was started on midodrine and octreotide in MICU in\naddition to, HD line placed by IR and bedside HD initiated.\nTunneled line was placed and used for UF as above.\n\n# RUE cellulitis: Unclear whether this was a true infection in\nsetting of significant swelling, likely secondary to anasarca.\nUENI negative for DVT. On exam, arm does not appear erythematous\nor particularly tender. No CXR findings to suspect SVC syndrome.\nStarted ampicillin/sulbactam for cellulitis in a diabetic on\n[**2112-9-16**] and showed significant improvement.  Seen by ID, who\nrecommended 7-10 days of abx, switched to vancomycin on [**2112-9-19**].\n Pt was treated until day of discharge with vanco and at this\npoint cellulitis had resolved.\n\n# Right-eye bacterial conjunctivitis: Treated with\nbacitracin/polymixin eye ointment.\n\n# Anemia: Unclear etiology.  Pt has had recent EGD ([**5-16**]) w/o\nevidence of varices. Pt has had a colonscopy x 4 years ago (no\nreport) and will need to d/w PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] transfused 1 unit on [**9-18**]\nwith appropriate bump.  Remained stable when on floor.\n\n# Pain: Held baclofen, gabapentin, and MSContin in the setting\nof increased somnolence.  As his MS improved he was restarted on\nbaclofen and given po oxycodone PRN for pain.\n\n# Hepatocellular CA: Recent CT scan showed stable disease.\nGiven multiple comorbidities, he was not a candidate for\ntherapy.  He aslo developed contrast nephropathy last CT scan\nand will be followed by AFP and U/S.  Pt's disease is currently\nend stage.  Palliative care consulted and pt had good\nunderstanding of prognosis of disease.  He was discharged with\ntransition to hospice care.\n\n# Chronic diastolic CHF: Continued carvedilol, hydralazine,\namlodipine.\n\n# PVD: Continued aspirin and statin.\n.\n# LLE ulcer: Wound care consulted.\n.\n# DM: Continued outpatient insulin glargine and sliding scale.\n.\n# Elevated uric acid: Has had elevated levels in the past.\nChecked CPK level.

You were initially admitted to the hospital\nfor right arm swelling and found to have a skin infection of\nthat arm (cellulitis).  You were started on antibiotics and\nslowly responded to this.  Doppler ultrasound did not show a\nblood clot.  Your eye was also found to have an infection\n(conjunctivitis), so you were given an antibiotic eye ointment.\n\nDuring your admission you were also found to have a pneumonia\nwhich required a short stay in the ICU.  We treated you with IV\nantibiotics and your pneumonia improved.\n\nWhile you were here, you also had an acute kidney injury.  This\nresulted in volume overload to the point where it became\ndifficult for you to breath.  We determined that your kidneys\nwere not able to remove the extra fluid by themselves, so we\nstarted you on dialysis.  Your kidney function improved after\ndialysis, so we started you on a different type of dialysis\ncalled ultra-filtration.  We have arranged for outpatient\ndialysis for you, which will happen three times a week.\n\nWe have made the following changes to your home medications:\nSTOP: hydralazine\nSTOP: gabapentin\nCHANGE: lasix from 40mg daily to 40mg twice daily\nCHANGE: insulin sliding scale\nSTART: Metolozone 2.5 mg daily\nSTART: potassium chloride 40meq twice daily\n\nWeigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more\nthan 3 lbs.\n\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nDepartment: LIVER CENTER\nWhen: TUESDAY [**2112-10-18**] at 11:45 AM\nWith: [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2424**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2422**]\nBuilding: LM [**Hospital Unit Name **] [**Location (un) 858**]\nCampus: WEST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name **] Garage\n\nDepartment: [**Hospital3 249**]\nWhen: FRIDAY [**2112-10-14**] at 10:10 AM\nWith: DR [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/[**Company 191**] POST [**Hospital 894**] CLINIC\nPhone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**]\nBuilding: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) 895**]\nCampus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage\nThis appointment is with a hospital-based doctor as part of your\ntransition from the hospital back to your primary care provider.\n[**Name10 (NameIs) 616**] this visit, you will see your regular primary care doctor\nin follow up\n\n\n\n"
