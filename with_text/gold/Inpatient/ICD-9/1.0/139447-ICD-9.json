She was admitted to the ICU for neuro\nchecks which were intact throughout her time in the ICU. She was\nseen by neurosurgery who recommended a a follow head CT. This CT\nwas not obtained as the patient able to participate in neuro\nchecks. Plastic surgery saw the patient and determined that her\nfacial fractures were nonoperative and she will follow up with\nthem in clinic and sinus precautions while she was hospitalized.\nHer pain was difficult to manage because of the suboxone but\nbecame manageable after the medication cleared her system.\n\nEvents in the TICU were the following:\n[**1-3**]: admitted to TSICU. acute pain consult - unable to place\nepidural. dilaudid PCA. ophtho exam.\n[**1-4**]: Resumed regular diet, home meds. Added PO oxycodone to\npain regimen. Decreased frequency of neurochecks to Q4h.\n\nShe was transferred to the surgical floor on [**1-5**]. She remained\nalert and oriented and neuro checks were performed q8h, with no\nchanges in neuro status. Her pain was frequently assessed and\nshe remained on the Dilaudid PCA initially and was transitioned\nto an oral narcotic pain regimen subsequently, with which she\nreported adequate pain relief. Her vitals signs were routinely\nmonitored and she remained hemodynamically stable. She was\nplaced on telemetry with continuous O2 monitoring given her rib\nfractures. It was noted that her O2 saturation was decreasing to\nthe high 80's on RA. The patient denied SOB and incentive\nspirometry and pulmonary toileting were encouraged. However,\ndifficulty remained weaning supplemental oxygen and a chest xray\nwas obtained  on [**1-9**] which showed a very small right pleural\neffusion  (old) and new, small loculated, right pleural or\nextrapleural fluid. However the xray showed resolution of prior\npulmonary edema when compared to prior xrays, no new focal\nconsolidation, and no evidence of prior pneumothorax seen\ninitially on CT scan at admission. The patient continued to deny\nany shortness of breath, and O2 her sats at discharge remained\nbetween 89-93% on RA (patient with significant smoking history).\n\nShe was tolerating a regular diet and started on a bowel regimen\ngiven her use of narcotics. A foley catheter was placed on\nadmission and removed on [**1-5**], at which time she voided without\ndifficulty.\n\nShe was evaluated by physical therapy and occupational therapy\nwho initially recommended discharge to an extended care facility\nfor further rehabilitation when medically stable. However, as\nshe progressed toward discharge her mobility greatly improved\nand she become much more independent and was able to dress\nherself independently. She was out of bed ambulating with\nsupervision at the time of discharge, and was discharged to home\nwith VNA services in place.\n\nHer blood sugars were monitored routinely and managed with her\nhome metformin and a sliding scale of regular insulin as needed.\nThey remained controlled in the 100's at the time of discharge\nso she was not continued on the sliding scale insulin.\n\nPlastic surgery was consulted initially for her facial\nfractures. It was determined that her facial fractures did not\nrequire operative intervention at that time. Plastics\nrecommended follow up as an outpatient, for which the patient\nwas scheduled at discharge.\n\nOrthopedics was consulted for new complaints of right shoulder\npain. Xrays were obtained (see pertinent results for details.)\nShe was noted to have weakness in her right shoulder which may\nbe secodary to pain vs. from a rotator cuff injury. However it\nwas decided that there was no acute injury and the patient was\nscheduled for orthopedic follow up as an outpatient. The patient\nwas given a sling for comfort.\n\nOpthlomology was consulted when the patient was in the ICU for\nher eye fracture who deferred to the plastic surgery team for\nacute management and recommended routine annual exams for\nDM/HTN.\n\nNeurosurgery was consulted initially for cerebral ecchymosis and\nSAH. The patient remained neurologically stable the neurosurgery\nsigned off.\n\nThe patient was scheduled for follow up at discharge in the [**Hospital 2536**]\nclinic on [**2119-1-31**].\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nlisinopril, atenolol, lasix, suboxone, simvastatin, Asa,\nprilosec, prozac, amitryptiline\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every\n6 hours).\n2. carisoprodol 350 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3\ntimes a day).\n3. atenolol 50 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n4. fluoxetine 20 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO QAM (once a\nday (in the morning)).\n5. amitriptyline 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at\nbedtime).\n6. simvastatin 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\n7. cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: Two (2)\nTablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n8. metformin 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n\n9. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\n10. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a\nday) as needed for constipation.\n11. omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)

In order to\ndecrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4\ntimes every hour while awake. This will help expand the samll\nairways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that\npool in the lungs.\nYou will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold\nagainst your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and\ndeep breathing.\nSymptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short\nperiods may ease the pain.\nDo NOT smoke.\nReturn to the ED right away for any acute shortness of breath,\nincreased pain or crackling sensation around your rips\n(crepitus).\nNarcotic pain medication can cause constipation. Thefore you\nshould take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid\nand fiber intake if possible.\nIf your doctor allows, non steriodal anti-inflammatory drugs are\nvery effective in controlling pain (i.e. Ibuprofen, Motrin,\nAdvil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side\neffects so make sure your doctor approves.\n\nPlease follow up as instructed below with the Acute Care\nService, orthopedics and plastic surgery.\n\nYou were also seen by the opthomology doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 1028**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] were in\nthe hospital who recommended that you have annual eye exams\ngiven your history of diabetes mellitus and high blood pressure.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nDepartment: DIV.
