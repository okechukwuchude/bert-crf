The group home staff\nnoted that she had a cough and body aches yesterday.  This\nmorning, she was walking hunched over and using her cane.  She\nhas the cane from hip replacement one year ago, but does not use\nit at baseline.  The staff noted that she started to shake while\non the toilet.  Her FBG was checked and was reportedly low on\nthe monitor (<20).  She was given sugar packets, and when her\nFBG was rechecked it was 180.  She was also given Tylenol 1000\nmg.  Her temperature was noted to be 100.3 afterwards.  EMS was\ncalled and brought her to the ED.  EMS found FBG 230, and her\nFBG was 238 in triage.

She was given a dose of Ceftriaxone in the ED for her\npositive UA. Her CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia.  She was\nadmitted to medicine for further workup and treatment.\n.\nOn the floor, she reported current fever, chills, and headache.\nShe does report a mild cough and congestion recently.  She\ndenied any other focal complaints such as chest pain, SOB,\nabdominal pain, dysuria, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

Febrile but not cultured (cultured in the last 24h)\n[**2-21**]: Afebrile for >24 hours.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient is a 34 year old female with cognitive delay and DM2\nnot currently on hypoglycemic agents who presented to the ED\nfrom her group home for unexplained hypoglycemia and fever.\nNegative infectious workup, but new intracranial bleed found on\nCT and MRI.\n.\n# Intraventricular Hemorrhage: CT head was obtained on [**2159-2-7**]\ndue to her persistent headache, lack of other localizing\nsymptoms, and history of cavernous malformations with\nintracerebral bleeding.  The CT showed acute intraventricular\nhemorrhage and enlarged ventricles.  Neurosurgery consult was\ncalled and an MRI/MRA was obtained.  The MRI showed similar\nfindings as the CT as well as a possible new SAH at the right\nvertex.  No emergent or urgent neurosurgical intervention was\nrequired at this time.  She was restarted on her home Lisinopril\n5 mg PO daily.  She was transferred to Neurology for further\nmanagement. A repeat head CT was completed [**2159-2-18**] with no\ninterval changes.\n.\n# Fever: She reportedly developed shaking and agitation while at\nher group home.  She was also given Tylenol 1000 mg and later\nnoted to have T 100.3 prior to arrival at the hospital.  She had\nT 100.8 in the ED.  Once on the floor, she was febrile to 104\nwith shaking chills, and continued to have intermittent fevers\nduring her stay.  She denies any focal symptoms except headache,\nbut reportedly had cough and myalgias at her group home.\nInfluenza and respiratory viral swab was negative by DFA as well\nas final cultures.  Urine culture showed no growth and blood\ncultures have been NGTD. She was found to have intraventricular\nhemorrhage as above, which can be associated with persistent\nfevers and likely explains her recent symptoms.  She had\nnegative viral studies.  Her fevers were treated symptomatically\nwith Acetaminophen 1000 mg PO Q6H PRN pain/fever. A full fever\nwork was in place. Multiple blood and urine cultures was taken\nand NGTD. A CT scan of the torso was completed and was non\ncontributory. An MRI of the right hip was also completed and was\nalso non contributory. An LP was performed and was abnormal\nsecondary to interventricular blood and no organism on gram\nstain. GPC's were isolated on urine [**2159-2-17**]. Her fever subsided\non Tylenol without antibiotics.\n.\n# Reported Hypoglycemia: It is unclear whether her reported\nepisode of hypoglycemia was a real event or an artifact from\nglucometer malfunction.  She has a history of DM2, but has not\nbeen on hypoglycemic agents recently.  The rapid correction of\nher hypoglycemia with oral sugar packets and sustained readings\nin the 200s by EMS and in the ED is strange.  Her shaking was\nlikely due to fever from an infection rather than hypoglycemia.\nShe was monitored with fingersticks QACHS and had hypoglycemia\nprotocol orders in place to treat any low readings.  Her FBG was\n121 on reaching the floor and has remained between 100 and 200\nduring her stay.\n.\n# UTI: Her UA on admission was positive and she received a dose\nof Ceftriaxone in the ED.  She was initially continued on\nCeftriaxone 1000 mg IV Q24H pending final urine culture results.\n Her urine culture came back negative and Ceftriaxone was\ndiscontinued after three doses had been given.\n.\n# Anemia / Thrombocytopenia: Her Hct on admission was 33.8,\nwhich is lower than her recent baseline in the high 30s.  She\nhas had a mild microcytic anemia in the past.  Her MCV is\ncurrently low normal at 84, but her RDW is high at 15.9.  Her\nplatelets have also been low over at least the last few months.\nThis could potentially represent a medication effect.\nThrombocytopenia is a relatively common side effect of Valproic\nacid, with a dose response.  Anemia and pancytopenia have also\nbeen associated with several of her other psych meds, but these\neffects are rare.  Her iron and hemolysis panels showed no\nevidence of either iron deficiency or hemolysis.\n.\n# Creatinine Elevation: Her Cr on admission was 1.2, increased\nslightly from a recent baseline around 0.9 (from [**2158-9-14**]).  Her\nLisinopril 5 mg PO daily was held initially.  Her Cr has since\nreturned to baseline, and her Lisinopril was restarted.\n.\n# Hypertension: Substituted Metoprolol tartrate 50 mg PO BID for\nhome succinate daily.  Her Lisinopril 5 mg PO daily was\ninitially held as mentioned above.  Due to her intracranial\nbleeding, her BP was controlled with goal SBP<140.  She was\nrestarted on her home Lisinopril 5 mg PO daily and ordered for\nHydralazine 10 mg IV Q6H to be given for SBP>140.\n.\n# Diabetes Mellitus: She reportedly has a history of DM2, but is\nnot currently on medications.  Her last HgbA1c was 5.5% on\n[**2158-9-14**] and was 6.2% on admission.  She was continued on a\ndiabetic diet during her stay.  Her FBGs were occasionally\nelevated during her stay into the 200s and she was started on a\nHumalog sliding scale.\n.\n# Hypothyroidism: Her TSH on admission was normal at 2.8, but\nher T4 was 3.9, which is somewhat low.  The meaning of these\nresults is unclear in the setting of an acute illness and can be\nreaddressed as an outpatient.  She was continued on\nLevothyroxine 25 mcg PO daily during her stay.\n.\n# Neuro/Psych: She was continue on her home regimen of\npsychiatric meds.\n.\n# GI Prophylaxis: Bowel regimen with Colace and Senna\n.\n# DVT Prophylaxis: She was initially kept on Heparin 5000 units\nSC TID.  This was discontinued after her intraventricular\nhemorrhage was found.  Pneumoboots were used therafter.\n.\n# Seizure history: No seizures here. She was on >24hr VEEG\nwithout capture of events. No changes to her medications (AEDs)\nwere made.\n.\n# Followup: She should follow up with her PCP.

During your stay, your blood sugars\nremained normal, but you continued to have fevers.  Testing\ninitially showed evidence of a urinary tract infection, but\nfinal culture results did not show any bacterial growth.  You\nreceived several doses of Ceftriaxone, an antibiotic, while the\nresults were pending.  You were also tested for influenza and\nseveral other viruses, but these tests were negative.  Because\nof your history of bleeding within the brain and your only other\nsymptom being headache, you had imaging of your head and this\nshowed a hemorrhage, this was stable with repeat imaging. You\nhad also imaging of your torso and hip which did not show a\nsource for your infection. We also were tested for possible\nseizures and this did not demonstrate seizures.\nAfter a full set of tests your fever was determined to be\nsecondary to your bleed.\n\nYour fevers were treated with Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen, which\nhelped you feel better.  None of your prior medications were\nchanged.  You should continue taking your medications as\npreviously prescribed and as indicated on your discharge\nmedication sheet.\n\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nAlso please have your PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 14030**] you to your Neurologist.\n\nProvider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14031**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 719**]\nDate/Time:[**2159-4-2**] 11:30\nProvider: [**Name10 (NameIs) 14032**],[**Name11 (NameIs) 14033**] [**Location (un) **] IM (NHB)\nDate/Time:[**2159-4-25**] 11:30\nProvider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 3210**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], DPM Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 543**]\nDate/Time:[**2159-5-22**] 11:20\n\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2159-2-23**]"
