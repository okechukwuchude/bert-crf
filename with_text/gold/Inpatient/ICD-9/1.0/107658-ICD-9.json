In the\nEmergency Room he was thoroughly evaluated by the Trauma team,\nVascular surgery, and Plastic surgery.  He underwent CT imaging\nof the head, neck, and torso. After review of these films\npatient was cleared to go to the OR.  The patient was initially\nadmitted to the Trauma service on [**2176-11-26**] and then transferred\nto the plastic surgery service on [**2176-11-28**]. On [**2176-11-26**], he\nunderwent an above the left knee amputation by the Vascular\nservice and then had a full-thickness skin graft measuring 40 x\n9 cm, a Split-thickness skin graft measuring 20 x 8 cm, and\nlocal tissue rearrangement of proximally based fasciocutaneous\nflap by Plastic Surgery.  A wound vac was applied to skin graft\nsites per protocol.  The patient tolerated the procedure well\nand was transferred to the PACU for post-operative recovery and\nthen to the Trauma SICU for close monitoring. On POD#2, the\npatient was transferred out of the Trauma SICU and onto the\nfloor on telemetry monitoring. On [**2176-12-2**], patient returned to\nOR for irrigation and debridement of left lower extremity wound\nand nonviable tissues. a split-thickness skin graft was taken\nfrom left lower extremity upper thigh area to cover stump wound\nmeasuring 26 x 19 cm.\n.\nNeuro: In the ED, pain was controlled with IV Fentanyl, Dilaudid\nand Methadone.  Post-operatively, the patient was evaluated by\nthe Acute Pain Service (APS) and started on Bupivacaine sciatic\ncatheter infusion and Bupivacaine femoral catheter infusion as\nwell as a dilaudid PCA.  APS also started the patient PO\nmethadone.  Patient's pain escalated on [**2176-11-27**] dilaudid PCA was\nincreased and APS added neurontin and tizanidine to his pain\nregimen.  On [**2176-11-28**], APS discontinued the tizanidine, and\ndecreased neurontin and dilaudid dosages for episodes of\nincreased sedation.  Bupivicaine catheters infusions and\nDilaudid PCA were discontinued on [**2176-11-30**].  The patient was\nstarted on PO Dilaudid and his Neurontin was increased to 600 mg\nTID.  Patient maintained on Methadone 40 mg Q6h.  This regimen\nwas very effective until patient returned to OR on [**2176-12-2**] for\nskin grafting to left stump sites.  Skin graft donor sites were\nvery painful for patient and he felt they were 'on fire'.  A\ndilaudid PCA was re-started to provide relief in the setting of\nacute pain.  This PCA was discontinued on [**2176-12-8**] per Chronic\nPain Service recommendations and he was given a home analgesia\nregimen prior to discharge consisting of oral dilaudid,\nmethadone, and neurontin.\n.\nCV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;\nvital signs were routinely monitored.\n.\nPulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint;\nvital signs were routinely monitored.\n.\nGI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until\ntolerating oral intake. His diet was advanced when appropriate,\nwhich was tolerated well. He was also started on a bowel regimen\nto encourage bowel movement. Foley catheter was removed on\nPOD#2. Intake and output were closely monitored. CT Torso on\n[**2176-11-26**] showed mild fat stranding in the left renal hilum,\nindicating question of hematoma and question of trauma to left\nrenal artery.  Patient continued with good urine output, stable\nCreatinine, and normal blood pressures so Vascular felt there\nwas no need for further intervention.\n.\nID: Patient was given IV Gentamcin and Cefazolin upon arrival to\nthe ED.  Post-operatively, the patient was started on IV\ncefazolin, then switched to PO cephalexin on POD#2.  Cephalexin\nwas discontinued on POD#13.  The patient's temperature was\nclosely watched for signs of infection.\n.\nMusculoskeletal: Patient was noted to have a left non-displaced\nulnar styloid fracture on x-ray and was placed in an ulnar\ngutter splint.\n.\nProphylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during\nthis stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as\npossible.\n.\nAt the time of discharge on POD#14, the patient was doing well,\nafebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet,\nambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well\ncontrolled.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMethadone 80 mg QD\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
