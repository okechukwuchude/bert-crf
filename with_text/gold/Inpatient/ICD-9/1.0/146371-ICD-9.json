Her lactate is down to 4.\n\nShe was diagnosed with Crohn's in [**2158**] and was started on\ninfliximab for about one year but lost response.  She developed\na perianal fistula on [**5-/2159**] which has been healing.  She has\nalso been tried on Humira, cyclosporine, mesalamine and\nprednisone without success.\n\nShe recently presented to the ED with similar complaints on\n[**2160-6-30**] and had a WBC of 34.  She was admitted to GI and\nunderwent colonoscopy which revealed a polypoid lesion 2-3 cm in\ndiameter at 25 cm into sigmoid colon.

Her CT scan\nwas consistent with a bowel perforation and she was taken to the\nOR for exploratory laparotomy, ileocecostomy, low anterior\nresection with an ileostomy,mucous fistula by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and a\nbladder repair with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9125**]. The case was complicated as\ndocumented in the operative note and there was a bladder\nlaceration repaired by urology. Two [**Doctor Last Name **] drains were placed.\nThe abdominal wound was irrigated, closed with suture at the\nfacia and left open given significant obesity and gross\ncontamination. The patient was admitted from the operating room\nto the surgical intensive care unit. The patient was intubated\nand monitored closely by the surgical and intensive care unit\nteams.\n\nIn the ICU a wound VAC was placed, which was changed every three\ndays by the surgical team.  Her intraoperative fluid culture\ngrew E. coli and klebsiella and her post-op blood culture grew\nE. coli and she was started on IV ciprofloxacin/Flagyl.  She\ncontinued to have leukocytosis and a mini-BAL was performed\nwhich later grew yeast.  At that point her antibiotic coverage\nwas broadened to vancomycin/ciprofloxacin/flagyl/fluconazole.\n\nThe patient was transferred from the surgical intensive care\nunit to the inpatient floor on [**2160-8-25**] on intravenous\nciprofloxacin/metrodiazole. The patients lab values and fever\ncurve were closely monitored and the patient was noted to have a\nconsistently elevated white blood cell count. In an effort to\ndetermine the cause of this consistently elevated white blood\ncell count the blood cultures were drain, peritoneal fluid from\nthe [**Location (un) 1661**]/[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was sent for culture, the patients\nsputum was cultured, and patient was sent for a CT scan of her\ntorso and abdomen to rule out intra-abdominal abscess. The CT\ntorso/abdomen showed no obvious intra-abdominal or intrapelvic\nabscess with filling defects within the segmental and\nsubsegmental branches of the right lower lobe pulmonary arteries\nis concerning for PE.  Because of dry cough, shortness of breath\nwith exertion, and atelectasis the patient was started on\nstanding Combivent nebulizing treatments.\n\nFor treatment of the patient's pulmonary embolism a heparin drip\n[**2160-8-27**] was initiated and the patient was started on 5mg of\nWarfarin on [**2160-8-28**] to bridge her to an INR of [**2-6**]. The\npatient's INR level on [**2160-8-29**] was 1.5 and the patient recieved\n5mg of Warfarin. On [**2160-8-30**] the patient's INR value was 2.7 and\nthe heparin drip was discontinued and the patient received 3mg\nof Warfarin. The patient's INR value on [**2160-8-31**] was 6.4. At this\ntime the Warfarin was held and the patients INR continued to\nclimb with a value of 7.3 on the afternoon of [**2160-8-31**], 7.8 on\n[**2160-9-1**], 7.7 on [**9-2**], and 7.9 on [**2160-9-3**]. On [**2160-9-3**] it was\ndecided to reverse the INR with 10 mg of Vitamin K orally. The\npatients INR on [**2160-9-4**] was 5.8 and the patient was again given\n10mg of vitamin K orally, also on [**2160-9-4**] the patient concluded\nher antibiotic/antifungal therapy which may have contributed to\nthis elevated INR. The patient's INR on [**2160-9-5**] was 2.6 and it\nwas determined that the patient could receive her first dose of\nWarfarin 3mg and be discharged to her selected rehabilitation\nhospital for INR checks and warfarin therapy. Her goal INR is\n[**2-6**].\n\nThe gram stain of the peritoneal fluid showed coagulase negative\nstaphylococcus and at this time the patient vancomycin and\nfluconazole were added to her antibiotic regimen. 14 days after\nblood cultures came back negative for E. coli her antibiotics\nwere narrowed to only vancomycin and fluconazole after which her\nWBC continued to decrease. The patient was tolerating a regular\ndiet at this time with supplements at each meal and had adequate\nstool and gas output from the ileostomy. The mucus fistula\ncontinued to produce a small amount of mucus. The mucus fistula\nwas flushed periodically with normal saline and covered with a\ndry sterile dressing. The patient was followed closely by the\nwound/ostomy nursing team. On post-operative day 13 the wound\nwas assessed by the chief surgical resident and attending and\nnoted to have necrotic fat and fibrinous tissue to the suture\nclosure at the abdominal fascia. The wound was debrided at the\nbedside and packed with a moist to dry saline dressing for 3\ndays for continued mechanical debridement and then the VAC\ndressing was replaced on post-op day 16. On post-op day 19, on\nVAC change, the wound had good granulation tissue.\nAntibiotic/antifungal therapy was discontinued on [**2160-9-4**]\n\nOn post-op day 10 the abdominal JP drain was putting out minimal\ndrainage and was discontinued.  On post-op day 14 the patient\nunderwent a cystogram to evaluate the bladder repair and was\nfound to have a continued bladder [**Date Range 3564**].  The Foley catheter and\nthe suprapubic JP drain were left in place.  On post-op day 16\nthe JP drain fluid was found to have a creatinine level of 2.9,\nconsistent with bladder [**Date Range 3564**].  Urology recommended continued\nbladder decompression with the Foley catheter for an additional\n14 days when a repeat cystogram will be obtained, this test is\nordered to take place on [**2160-9-16**] in the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] building on the\n[**Hospital Ward Name **] at 930 in the morning. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9125**] is operating that\nday at [**Hospital1 18**] will eb in touch with the rehabilitation hospital\nto set up a follow-up appointment arrangement.\n\nBecause of severe deconditioning, physical therapy was consulted\non transfer from the ICU to the inpatient floor and they\nrecommended that when ready for discharge, she should go to\nrehab and that in the meantime she should be out of bed to chair\nwith [**Doctor Last Name 2598**] every day, which she has generally been compliant\nwith.\n\nDue to the extensive volume requirement she had on admission due\nto her hypotension and SIRS she became very edematous and her\nweight was 113 kg on admission.  With diuresis as she improved\nher weight decreased to 95 kg on post-op day 16.  On exam her\nlegs continue to have significant venous congestion, but the\nglobal edema has decreased significantly over her hospital\ncourse. And her peripheral access improved.\n\nDuring the patient's stay on the inpatient unit, the patient\nverbalized feelings of anxiety and was observed to have a flat\naffect which was gradually improving at the end of her hospital\nstay. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 636**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 28528**], NP had discussions at length with the\npatient and the patient's husband about initiating\nanti-depressant therapy with Celexa. Because of the elevated INR\nand the patients apprehension to this therapy the medication was\nnot initiated. On the last day of hospitalization , the patient\nverbalized that she would like to attempt to deal with the\nanxiety and mood on her own but would reach out to the care\nproviders at the [**Hospital **] hospital regarding this therapy\nif she decided it was needed.\n\nUpon discharge, the patient was evaluated by the clinical nurse\nspecialist and she was found to have adequate access for\nperipheral blood draws for her INR monitoring. The central line\nin the upper left chest was removed. The VAC dressing was taken\ndown prior to discharge with the intent that it will be\nreapplied on her arrival to the rehabilitation facility. She\nrecieved 3mg of Warafrin prior to discharge on [**2160-9-5**].\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nAtenolol 50mg daily\nDiphenoxylate-atropine prn\nEzetimibe 10mg daily\nLasix 20mg daily\nMetformin 50mg [**Hospital1 **]\nNiacin SR 500mg daily\nOmeprazole 20mg daily\nProchlorperazine Maleate prn\nRisedronate 35 qwk\nErgocalciferol 1000mg daily\nMultivitamin daily\nPercocet prn\nImodium PRN\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

You were\nvery sick at this time and the procedure was very complicated.\nThe perforation of your bowel required significant resection and\nan ostomy was created from your small intestine to give your\ncolon a chance to heal. Also, a mucus fistula was made. You\nshould continue to care for the mucus fistula as well as the\nostomy as you have [**Doctor First Name **] instructed by the wound/ostomy nursing\nteam. The large surgical wound in your abdomen was left open to\nprevent a large wound infection, your abdomen had a large amount\nof contamination during the procedure. This has been treated\nwith VAC therapy and debriedment and has showed  signs of\nimprovment, the wound has decreased in size and has healthy\ntissue formation. The VAC therapy will continue with dressing\nchanges every three days. The dressing will be changed by the\nnurses at the rehabilitation facility. Ther are multiple\npressure ulcers on your bottom, it is important to stay clean\nand the nurses at the rehabilitation center will apply dressings\n\n\nDuring your hospital stay, you developed a blood clot in your\nlung. You were started on the medication coumadin for treatment\nof this clot. You will need to continue this medication for\napproximately 6 months. The purpose of this medication is to\nthin the blood to prevent further clot formation. The INR level\nof your blood needs to be monitored frequently and in your case,\nit will need to be monitored closely as you have been very\nsensitive to this medication. At the rehabilitation hospital,\nthey will monitor your coumadin therapy and regulate the dose as\nneeded. When you are home, your primary care provider will need\nto do this. You will take 3 mg of coumadin daily at 4pm. You\nwill have an INR monitored on [**2160-9-6**]. Your goal INR is [**2-6**]. You\nwill need to take the coumadin daily for 6 months.\n\nContinue your physical therapy as prescribed by a physical\ntherapist with a goal of walking. No heavy lifting for 2 months,\nno bathing or swimming for 6 months after surgery.\n\nYou should monitor your bowel function. The ileostomy will\nproduce loose stool becuase it is the small intestine however\nthe amount of stool produced should be between 500-1200cc daily.\nIf it is less than 500cc or more than 1200cc please call the\noffice for assistance. If it is greater than 1200cc in one day\nthere is a risk that you could become dehydrated. You are\ncurrently taking immodium to help reduce the stool output and\nyou may continue this therapy at rehab. Eat small frequent\nmeals, continue your boost suppplementation, and stay well\nhydrated. Please continue the bowel regimen of immodium and\nmetamucil wafers. As your output decreases the staff at the\nrehabilitaion facility can titrate your bowel regimen as needed.\nThey may call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as needed.\n\nWe have talked about starting the antidepressant Celexa to help\nyou with your mood and motivation. At this time you have decided\nto continue to cope with your anxiety on your own.
