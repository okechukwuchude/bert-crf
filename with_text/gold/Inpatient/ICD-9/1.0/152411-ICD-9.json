Dyspnea\n   History concerning for possible pneumonia given fever and cough. His\n   CXR shows no clear infiltrate, which raises the possibility of an\n   atypical bacterial infection or viral pneumonia such as influenza. In\n   the setting of recent hospitalization and rehab, health care associated\n   pathogens much be addressed and could have been easily missed with\n   recent ceftriaxone, azithromycin. In setting of Parkinsons, may be\n   prone to aspiration. Other possibilities include recurrent mucous\n   plugging, COPD exacerbation. He certainly may have an element of HF.\n   ACS, PE seems less likely.\n   - Gram stain and culture of sputum, DFA with respiratory viral panel\n   - Urine legionella antigen, blood cultures\n   - Empiric vancomycin and Zosyn, plus levoflox (recently got azithro)\n   - Continue bronchodilators, mucomyst nebs\n   - Chest PT\n   - Check ABG\n   - PA/Lat CXR when stabilizes\n   - Hold on further diuresis for now\n   - Recheck BNP\n   - Consider swallow eval\n   .\n   2. Fever\n   Suspect due pulmonary infection, as above. No diarrhea to suggest C\n   diff, UA without evidence of UTI. Other noninfectious causes such as PE\n   seem less likely.\n   - Pulmonary workup as above\n   - UA/UCX, blood cultures\n   .\n   3. Acute on chronic renal failure\n   Labs suggestive of a pre-renal picture in setting of diuresis, poor PO\n   - Hold on further diuresis\n   - Urinalysis, urine electrolytes\n   - Follow urine output, renally dose meds\n   - Hold lisinopril\n   .\n   4. HTN\n   Holding lisinopril in setting of elevated Cr. Continue diltiazem.\n   .\n   5. Parkinsons\n   Continue home Sinemet\n   .\n   6. PVD s/p stent\n   Continue home warfarin, ASA, statin.

He was transferred to\n[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.\n.\nIn the ER, vitals were 100.9 114 148/76 98% 3L -> 100% on BiPAP.\n Exam with rhonchi with supraclavicular retractions. CXR showing\nmild pulmonary edema. Given vanco, ctx in ED, respiratory\nattempted secretions but too thick. IP called - stent is in same\nplace, plan for scope in MICU. Started on BIPAP and admitted to\nMICU for further care.\n.\nOn evaluation in the ICU, pt reports SOB is improved. He recalls\nbreathing worsened day prior to admission.

Preexisting Y-stent within the trachea and\nmain bronchi\nappear unchanged. Interval worsening of pulmonary edema as well\nas slight\nprogression in degree of right lower lobe atelectasis with\nassociated\nelevation of right hemidiaphragm.

Minimal patchy\nopacity at the left base also likely represents atelectasis,\naccompanied by a small pleural effusion.\n.\n\n[**2148-6-4**] 05:16AM BLOOD WBC-11.7* RBC-3.63* Hgb-10.4* Hct-31.7*\nMCV-88 MCH-28.6 MCHC-32.7 RDW-16.3* Plt Ct-225\n[**2148-5-31**] 04:52AM BLOOD WBC-17.0* RBC-3.30* Hgb-9.8* Hct-28.1*\nMCV-85 MCH-29.6 MCHC-34.7 RDW-16.6* Plt Ct-251\n[**2148-5-28**] 07:00AM BLOOD WBC-13.0* RBC-3.65* Hgb-10.6* Hct-31.3*\nMCV-86 MCH-29.1 MCHC-33.9 RDW-16.2* Plt Ct-267\n[**2148-5-30**] 02:37AM BLOOD Neuts-89.8* Lymphs-6.0* Monos-4.1 Eos-0.1\nBaso-0\n[**2148-6-4**] 05:16AM BLOOD PT-13.8* PTT-30.3 INR(PT)-1.2*\n[**2148-6-4**] 05:16AM BLOOD Plt Ct-225\n[**2148-5-30**] 02:37AM BLOOD PT-18.0* PTT-27.1 INR(PT)-1.6*\n[**2148-5-29**] 01:16PM BLOOD PT-24.9* PTT-34.7 INR(PT)-2.4*\n[**2148-5-28**] 07:00AM BLOOD PT-26.5* PTT-32.8 INR(PT)-2.6*\n[**2148-6-4**] 05:16AM BLOOD Glucose-87 UreaN-25* Creat-0.9 Na-139\nK-4.3 Cl-103 HCO3-29 AnGap-11\n[**2148-5-29**] 04:15AM BLOOD Glucose-146* UreaN-33* Creat-1.4* Na-137\nK-4.1 Cl-102 HCO3-23 AnGap-16\n[**2148-5-29**] 04:15AM BLOOD CK(CPK)-95\n[**2148-5-28**] 03:23PM BLOOD CK(CPK)-127\n[**2148-5-28**] 07:00AM BLOOD CK(CPK)-106\n[**2148-5-29**] 04:15AM BLOOD CK-MB-NotDone cTropnT-0.01\n[**2148-5-28**] 03:23PM BLOOD CK-MB-5 cTropnT-0.03*\n[**2148-5-28**] 07:00AM BLOOD CK-MB-6 proBNP-972*\n[**2148-5-28**] 07:00AM BLOOD cTropnT-0.03*\n[**2148-6-4**] 05:16AM BLOOD Calcium-8.7 Phos-3.6 Mg-1.9\n[**2148-5-28**] 07:00AM BLOOD Calcium-9.2 Phos-3.6 Mg-1.7 Cholest-144\n[**2148-5-28**] 07:00AM BLOOD Triglyc-63 HDL-48 CHOL/HD-3.0 LDLcalc-83\n[**2148-5-29**] 01:16PM BLOOD Vanco-5.0*\n[**2148-5-29**] 09:43AM BLOOD Type-ART pO2-73* pCO2-38 pH-7.42\ncalTCO2-25 Base XS-0\n[**2148-5-29**] 09:43AM BLOOD Lactate-0.7\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nIn brief, Mr [**Known lastname **] is an 80M w COPD (on home Bipap)), pulmonary\nfibrosis, and tracheobronchomalacia s/p Y-stent in [**2146**], PVDz\ns/p LE stenting on Warfarin, Parkinson's dz, and recent\nadmissions for similar complaints, who was admitted with\nincreased respiratory distress, s/p MICU stay.\n.\n# DYSPNEA: Likely multifactorial from combination of HCAP\n(fever, cough, infiltrate on CXR [**5-29**], leukocytosis), acute\nexacerbation of COPD from infection (given wheezing, O2\nrequirement), possible recurrent mucous plugging given extensive\nbaseline pulmonary disease/bronchiectasis. Acute on chronic\nsystolic CHF exacerbation (LVEF 40% [**5-/2147**], mild pulm edema on\nCXR at OSH) and aspiration in the setting of Parkinson's dz also\nconsidered, esp w witnessed aspiration of chicken broth as\ninpatient. ACS/PE seemed less likely, cardiac enzymes negative.\nSputum grew GNRs and Proteus, for which Meropenem was started\nfor a 10-day course ([**Date range (1) 51975**]). Blood cxs negative.\nBronchoscopy was performed and pt taken to the OR for\ntracheostomy and T-tube placement for suctioning. Necrotic skin\nwas seen around the incision, hence vancomycin was started for a\n10-day course ([**Date range (1) 72760**]). The COPD exacerbation was treated\nwith prednisone initially with 40mg, with plan for taper over 15\ndays.  Taper should begin on [**6-5**] at 20mg through [**6-7**], then\n10mg on [**6-8**] to [**6-10**], then 5mg on [**6-11**] to [**6-13**], then 2mg [**6-14**] to\n[**6-16**], then 1mg [**6-17**] to [**6-19**].  Patient was also treated with\nbronchodilators/acetylcysteine nebs and supplemental oxygen as\nneeded. Pt evaluated w video speech and swallow, showed\nDysphagia Outcome\nSeverity Scale (DOSS) rating of level 5, mild dysphagia,\nrecommended repeat instrumental evaluation at rehab prior to\nupgrading patient's diet or if patient continues to improve.\nTracheostomy capped on discharge, which the pt is tolerating\nwell. Oxygenating on room air > 93%.\n.\n# tracheostomy site: it was felt patient had a tracheostomy site\ninfection, was initiated on vancomycin on [**5-29**], with plan to\ncomplete 10d course, to end [**6-8**].\n.\n# Acute renal failure: Cr 1.5 up from recent baseline of Cr ~1.\nLikely prerenal in the setting of diuresis, poor PO intake and\nacute processes (infection). Lisinopril was held until Cr\nresolved to baseline. Cr=1 on discharge.\n.\n# HTN: SBP varied in the 100-160 range given acute\nhospitalization. Mostly in the 130s on discharge on home regimen\n(diltiazem, lisinopril).\n.\n# Anemia: normocytic, likely [**2-19**] ACD and possibly acute losses\nfrom procedures. Stable at baseline Hct ~30 on discharge.\n.\n# PVD s/p stent: Coumadin held for tracheostomy, restarted on\n[**2148-6-3**], will need INR monitoring and adjustments in dosing.\nPatient's coumadin was initially held, then restarted [**6-3**] at\n7.5mg.  This will need to be followed at rehab, with goal inr 2\nto 3.\n- continue home ASA, statin\n- continue coumadin - will need inr check until therapeutic\n.\n# Parkinson's dz: stable, continued home carbidopa/levodopa on\ndischarge.\n.\n# Hyperlipidemia: stable, continued home statin.\n.\n# Depression/Anxiety: stable, continued home venlafexine.\n.\nCODE STATUS: FULL\nCommunication: Daughter [**Name (NI) 1785**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) **])\n\nMedications on Admission:\nLevofloxacin 500mg daily\nSaline nebs QID between dunebs\nDuonebs QID\nMucomyst 10% 4cc nebs TID\nOmeprazole 20 daily\nVelafaxine XR 37.5 daily\nWarfarin 6mg daily\nNeurontin 400mg TID\nLisinopril 5mg daily\nLidoderm patch\nFolate, Colace, Guiafenesin, Mag Oxide, Miconazole\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
