The patient was then found to have bilateral thigh hematomas\n   that are likely the cause of his drop in hematocrit.\n   This nurse case manager was contact[**Name (NI) **] by the MICU resident and informed\n   that the patient would likely be ready to return to [**Hospital1 25**] today so a\n   call was placed to the facility to have their liaison nurse complete a\n   screen and seek payer authorization for the patient\ns return.\n   This NCM also met with the patient\ns mother in the [**Name (NI) 8319**], and she\n   indicated that the family may not want the patient to return to\n   [**Hospital1 25**], but she will defer to the judgment of her son [**Name (NI) **].  [**Name2 (NI) **]\n   should be in to visit the patient later today and this NCM will speak\n   to him at that time.  In anticipation of the possibility that the\n   family does not want the patient to return to [**Hospital1 25**], a referral has\n   been made to [**Hospital6 6804**] as the family had previously\n   considered the facility and ended up choosing [**Hospital1 25**] instead.\n   This NCM will continue to follow closely with the MICU team to\n   facilitate the patient\ns transfer to LTACH when indicated.\n   Please page for any questions, concerns or change in the discharge\n   plan.\n   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 596**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5890**], RN, BSN\n   MICU Service Case Manager\n   Phone:  2-7925/7-0306\n   Pager:  [**Numeric Identifier **]\n"

He had cyclic fevers and tachycardia throughout the\nadmission, necessitating multiple antibiotic regimens,eventually\nthought to be secondary to a central neurologic process.  He was\nfound to have an SVC thrombus and was started on Lovenox 100 mg\n[**Hospital1 **].  He was discharged to [**Hospital6 **] on [**2131-7-5**].\n.\nAt [**Hospital1 **], the patient was found to have frequent seizure\nactivity and was thus transferred back to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2131-7-9**].\nDuring this hospital stay, the patient's anti-epileptic regimen\nwas fine-tuned, and he continued to spike cyclic fevers.  He\ngrew multiple different colonies of Pseudomonas and was started\non Ceftaz and Tobramycin, which was continued until [**2131-8-14**].  He\nwas also found to have hypercalcemia, hyponatremia, and\nhypothyroidism during this admission, which were treated with\nVitamin D, fluid restriction, and levothyroxine, respectively.\nHe was then discharged on [**8-12**] back to [**Hospital1 **].\n.\nAt [**Hospital1 **], the patient again developed recurrent fevers over\nthe past three days with a rising leukocytosis and he was placed\nback on Tobramycin on [**8-16**].

He was given a total of 4 U PRBCs, and his Hct\nremained stable in the mid 20s range. He had been on lovenox for\ntreatment of superior mesenteric vein thrombosis. The source of\nthe bleed was indentified to be a thigh hematoma. His thigh\ncircumference remained stable at 20'' right and 18'' left. CT of\nthighs/pelvic did not show evidence of retroperitoneal\nexpansion. Lovenox was stopped, and he was placed back on\nHeparin SQ for DVT prophylaxis.\n\n# Hypotension:  The patient was hypotensive upon arrival the the\nICU. This was also attributed to  blood loss.  His blood\npressure was controlled with IVF and pRBC transfusion.\n\n# Fevers, leukocytosis:  He has had a history of intermittent\nfevers which have been attributed to central sources. He again\npresented with fever. His presenting WBCs were elevated, as they\nhave been in the past, but trended down during admission. With\nregards to sources of infection, there was concern for a\nrespiratory process, given increase in secretions. The CXR\nhowever remained without findings suggestive of pneumonia. Also\ncultures obtained from his PICC line on [**8-20**] grew GPC in [**2-7**]\nbottles (from one PICC draw)  Peripheral cultures from this day\nwere negative. The PICC line was discontinued on [**8-21**] and he was\nnot started on antibiotics as this did not appear to be an\nactive infection given decreasing WBC and improved mental\nstatus.\n\n# Hyperglycemia:  Sugars on prsentation were 307 and he was\ncontinued on a Humalog ISS.\n\n# Hypothyroidism: Continued Levoxyl 50 mcg daily.  He will need\nto have TSH and FT4 levels checked in two weeks.\n\n# Seizures:  He had no seizure activity.  His total and free\ndilantin levels were 7 and 2.1, respectively.  His dilantin dose\nwas decreased to 200 mg tid and a daily additional dose of 500\nmg if his total dilantin level is less than 7.  He should\ncontinue to have dilantin levels/free dilantin levels checked\ndaily and his dose should be adjusted accordingly.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMultivitamins One (1) ML PO DAILY\nIpratropium-Albuterol Aerosol 4-6 puffs Q6H\nAlbuterol Sulfate (0.083 %) Nebulization Q2H prn for\nsob/wheezing.\nAcetaminophen 160 mg/5 mL Solution. 20 mL PO Q6H prn\nRISS\nEnoxaparin 100 mg/mL [**Hospital1 **]\nFolic Acid 1 mg daily\nErgocalciferol 50,000 unit twice weekly (Mon/Th)\nDextromethorphan Poly Complex SR 10 ML PO BID prn cough\nLevothyroxine 50 mcg daily\nPhenytoin 300mg PO TID (3 times a day) (12, 6, 10 PM)\nPhenytoin 500 mg at 0600.\nFamotidine 20 mg PO BID\nKeppra 2,000 mg [**Hospital1 **]\nLorazepam 1 mg q6h\nPercocet 5-325 mg Tablet PO q4h prn for pain\nHydrocortisone Sod Succinate 100 mg 1345\nMetoprolol 12.5 mg TID\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

We stopped the lovenox\nand transfused you with blood.  We also gave you fluids.  Both\nof these helped improve your blood pressure.\n\nWhile you were here, we also cultured bacteria from your lungs.\nWe think this is related to colonization rather than active\ninfection.  We also cultured a bacteria from your PICC line, so\nwe discontinued your PICC on [**8-21**].\n\nWhile you were here, we made the following changes to your\nmedications:\n1. We decreased you Dilantin dose to 200 TID.  The 500 mg\nmorning dose should only be given as needed if the Dilantin\nlevel is low.\n\nPlease return to the hospital if you have worsening fevers,\nchills, shortness of breath, or any other serious concerns.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nContact your primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] a follow-up\nappointment in two to four weeks.  You will need to have your\nthryoid studies checked in about two weeks.\n\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2131-8-24**]"
