Hepatology saw patient in ED and it\nwas decided that ERCP was not indicated.  The patient was\nstarted on IV vancomycin/Unasyn for cholangitis treatment.  He\nwas also continued on his home ursodiol and pain regimen.  His\npain resolved in one day and he never developed any criteria of\nsepsis. Vancomycin was discontinued and a PICC line was placed.\nHe was sent home with VNA to receive 6 more days of Unasyn and\nthen was to continue with 7 days of Augmentin.\n.\n# Hypotension: The patient had brief episode in ED responsive to\nIVF bolus, but while in the MICU had no recurrent episodes.\nPossibly related to transient bacteremia within biliary system.\n He was continued on IV antibiotic treatment.\n.\n# Mild rales bilaterally. Patient has no history of heart\nfailure, but he was given 4L of total IVF in the ED prior to\nadmission.  He was not diuresed while in the MICU.\n.\n# Depression/anxiety:  The patient was continued on his home\nWellbutrin and citalopram.\n.\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\nMr. [**Known lastname **] was sent home with VNA services for assistance with his\nPICC line and IV antibiotic therapy. He has follow up\nappointments with his PCP and the liver transplant center.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\n- bupropion HCl 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]\n- citalopram 20 mg daily\n- gabapentin 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]\n- metoclopramide 5 mg TID PRN nausea\n- oxycodone 5 mg q6h PRN pain\n- ursodiol [Actigall] 1500 mg daily\n- acetaminophen 650 mg Tablet Extended Release, 2 tabs PRN\n- famotidine [Pepcid] unknown dosage\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. ampicillin-sulbactam 3 gram Recon Soln Sig: Three (3) gram\nInjection Q6H (every 6 hours) for 5 days.\nDisp:*60 gram* Refills:*0*\n2.
