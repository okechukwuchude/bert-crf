Patient reports that he was\ngardening with his wife at 11:30, and he almost fell due to\nright\nleg weakness.  He went into the house to sit down and was\ninitially feeling a bit better, but his wife was very concerned,\nso she took him to his PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] also apparently told him that\nhis face looked asymmetric.  He noted that as he was waiting to\nsee his primary care physician he continued to have mild\ndifficulty walking and right leg weakness.  In addition, while\nat\nthe PCP he reports that for a few hours he was unable to speak\nproperly.  It is noted in the medical record that he was\nanswering questions appropriately but then at times repeating\nnon-word answers.  His speech also seemed slurred to them as\nwell\nas the patient.  He denies any difficulty understanding\nquestions.  In addition to his speech, language, and weakness\nissues he also notes that in the past he has had long-standing\nissues with discoordination possibly due to a \"mini-stroke,\" and\nthis was also worse today while in general it had been improving\nover the past few years.  His PCP was concerned regarding a\nstroke, so sent him to the emergency room where a CT scan was\nobtained revealing a right basal ganglia hemorrhage about 1x1\nand\n2 cm in the craniocaudal direction.  He was noted to have\nelevated blood pressure with SBP around 180, but since he was\nimproving neurologically, they did not lower it. Otherwise, upon\nquestioning he endorses possibly right leg tingling but denies\nheadache, right arm weakness.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nHypertension\nHyperlipidemia\nDiabetes mellitus type 2\nAdrenal insufficiency/Addison's disease - needs stress dose\nsteroids 100 mg is his crisis dose\nCardiac disease - pacemaker, aortic valve porcine replacement,\napparently was on plavix up until 1-2 weeks ago, discontinued\nand\nreplaced with 325 mg aspirin--unknown why\nPacemaker recently interrogated and atrial fibrillation noted\n\n\nSocial History:\nLives with wife, former television and antenna repairman\nEtOH: [**12-8**] drink daily (increased recently as his wife pours\nmore now)\ntobacco: denies\ndrugs: denies\n\n\nFamily History:\ndenies family history of neurologic disease, early\nstroke, clotting or bleeding disorder\n\n\nPhysical Exam:\nGeneral: Awake, cooperative, NAD.\nHEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in\noropharynx\nNeck: Supple, no nuchal rigidity\nPulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W\nCardiac: RRR, nl.

CT head from OSH reveals right basal ganglia bleed\ndifferential diagnosis includes amyloid, unlikely because not\nlobar, tumor, or arteriovenous malformation, but far more likely\nhypertensive given known history of hypertension and classic\nlocation of bleed.  Not a candidate for MRI given pacer.\n\nNeuro:\npatient was admitted to neuro ICU, attending [**Doctor Last Name **] a SBP < 160\nwas maintained using emolol.  patient's ASA and sc heparin were\ninitially held until day 3.  Patient progressed well.  on\ndischarge patient's weakness was limited only to a fine R\nprotonator drift and 4+ strength in biceps.  Cardiac enzymes\nwere negative.

Patients Phos was noted to be 2.2 and was given 1\npacket of neutro phos.\n\nDM:\n\npatient was restarted on his metformin w. insulin sliding scale\ncoverage.\n\nHTN:\n\nPatients BP was controlled with Atenolol and Lisinopril 5 mg PO\ndaily was started.\n\nAdrenal insufficiency:\n\nPatient was continued on home doses of prednisone and\nfludrocortisone.\n\nDVT prophylaxis. was kept on pneumoboots before restarting\nsubcutaneous heparin\n\ndispo: patient was re-evaluated by PT who stated that patient\nwas capable of going home with only minor deficits remaining.\n\n****spoke with patient's wife on the phone and made her aware of\nall the medication changes that were made.  Lisinopril was\ncalled into pharmacy at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 85048**].  Patient also made aware\nto cont. on Aspirin and to follow up with PCP early next week.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nAlendronate 70 mg qweek\nMetformin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **]\nPrednisone 2.5 mg daily\nAspiring 325 mg daily\nAtenolol 50 mg daily\nFludrocortisone 0.1 mg daily\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Lisinopril 5 mg PO daily\n\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nHome With Service\n\nFacility:\nDiversified VNA and hospice\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\n12 x 10 mm hemorrhagic stroke in the left basal ganglia.\nHigh blood pressure\nDiabetes\nHyperlipidemia\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nLevel of Consciousness: Lethargic but arousable.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker\nor cane). Inpatient PT noted pt. has walker at home for use and\nthat patient would benefit from home PT for home safety eval and\nto progress mobility.\nMental Status: Confused - sometimes.\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nYou suffered a 12 x 10 mm hemorrhagic focus in the left basal\nganglia portion of the brain, without significant mass effect,\nmidline shift, intraventricular extension or subarachnoid\nhemorrhage. It was thought that this was most likely related to\nyour high blood pressure.  You were also found to have\nuncontrolled diabetes and cholesterol.  You were started on\nSimvastatin for cholesterol.  You will need to follow up with\nyour primary doctor regarding your diabetes management.   You\nwere initially stopped on your Aspirin secondary to bleed in\nyour brain.\n\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nFollow up with your Primary care physician for further\nmanagement.\n\nFollow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] for neurology. Please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 657**]\n\n\n                             [**Name6 (MD) 4267**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4268**] MD, [**MD Number(3) 5023**]\n\nCompleted by:[**2188-6-10**]"
