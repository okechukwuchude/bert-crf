No findings of\ninfarct are evident by CT.\nCTA: The intracranial internal carotid arteries are normal, as\nare the middle and anterior cerebral arteries. Minimal\natherosclerotic disease is present within the cavernous segments\nof the internal carotid arteries bilaterally. There is left\nvertebral artery dominance and both vertebral arteries\ncontribute the formation of a normal-appearing basilar artery.\nThe posterior cerebral arteries are normal.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Similar volume of localized hemorrhage within the\ninterpeduncular and\nprepontine cistern with minimal volume of subarachnoid blood\nnear the vertex without additional hemorrhage.\n2. No aneurysm is identified, and the findings suggest the\npossibility for\nperimesencephalic hemorrhage, though an occult aneurysm is not\nfully excluded.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient was admitted to the ICU for close neurological\nmonitoring.She was started on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.\nWithin a few hours she underwent a cerebral angiogram which\nshowed no source of bleeding. Later on her first hospitalization\nday she was transferred to the floor. She underwent both a MRA/I\nof her Brain and C-Spine which showed no source for bleeding.\nThe patient was monitored for 48 hours with improvement in her\nsymptoms she was neurologically intact. On her day of discharge\nshe underwent a CTA which showed a small cluster of vascular\nchannels noted in the midline frontal region which could\nrepresent a venous aneurysm with associated DVA. It was\nrecommend that Ms [**Known lastname 1140**] would have a follow up angiogram on [**10-11**] she will be returning for a angiogram. She was aware to\nreturn if she developed any new or worsening symptoms.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nNone\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
