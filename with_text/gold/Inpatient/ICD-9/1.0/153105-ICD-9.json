No spontaneous echo contrast\nis seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.\nNo atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is\nmild left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity\nis moderately dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion is\nnormal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly\ndepressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). Right ventricular chamber size is\nnormal. with normal free wall contractility. The aortic root is\nmoderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is\nmoderately dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the\naortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.\nThere are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic\naorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic\nvalve stenosis. Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The\nmitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral\nregurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at time of\nsurgery.\nPOST-BYPASS: LV systolic function appears improved to normal\n(LVEF 55%) RV systolic function remains normal. There is a well\nseated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic position. A\ntube graft is visualized in the ascending aorta. The study is\notherwise unchanged from prebypass.\nIMPRESSION: Moderately dilated aortic sinuses measuring 5.0 cm\nwithout effacement of the sinotubular junction. Ascending aorta\nis moderately dilated to 4.8 cm and tapers down to 4.0 cm\ndistally. The aortic valve is trileaflet with poor coaptation.\nSevere aortic regurgitation without aortic stenosis is seen.\nModerate mitral regurgitation is seen.. Mildly depressed LV\nfunction.\n.\n\n[**2106-4-12**] 05:15AM BLOOD WBC-9.3 RBC-2.95* Hgb-9.8* Hct-30.2*\nMCV-103* MCH-33.3* MCHC-32.5 RDW-14.7 Plt Ct-98*\n[**2106-4-15**] 05:44AM BLOOD Hct-29.8*\n[**2106-4-12**] 05:15AM BLOOD PT-14.7* INR(PT)-1.4*\n[**2106-4-12**] 05:15AM BLOOD Plt Ct-98*\n[**2106-4-13**] 04:50AM BLOOD PT-15.8* INR(PT)-1.5*\n[**2106-4-14**] 05:20AM BLOOD PT-19.3* INR(PT)-1.8*\n[**2106-4-15**] 05:44AM BLOOD PT-25.0* INR(PT)-2.4*\n[**2106-4-15**] 05:44AM BLOOD UreaN-25* Creat-1.0 Na-136 K-4.1 Cl-104\n[**2106-4-14**] 05:20AM BLOOD Mg-2.2\n\nCXR [**4-12**]:\n\nMild bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged from prior.\nBibasilar\nopacities , a combination of pleural effusions and atelectasis\nhave increased\non the right and minimally improved on the left. The upper lungs\nare clear.\nThere is no pneumothorax. Widened mediastinum has improved.\nCardiomegaly has\nimproved. Sternal wires are aligned.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname 3094**] was admitted one day before surgery for routine\nwork-up and Heparin since he was on Coumadin for atrial\nfibrillation. On [**2106-4-8**] he was brought to the operating room\nwhere he underwent an aortic valve replacement and ascending\naorta replacement. Please see operative note for surgical\ndetails. Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for\ninvasive monitoring in stable condition. Later this day he was\nweaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.\nHe was started on beta-blockers, diuretics and gently diuresed\ntowards his pre-op weight. On post-op day one he was transferred\nto the step-down floor for further care. Chest tubes and\nepicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol.  On POD2 he\ndeveloped rapid atrial fibrillation, loaded with IV/PO\namiodarone.  His beta-blocker was titrated for rate control.\nHis Coumadin was restarted for his history of DVT.  Prednisone 5\nmg was restarted which he has been taken for several years. His\npain was well controlled with acetaminophen and low-dose\nnarcotics. He was seen by physical therapy for strength and\nmobility.  On POD # 6 he was noted to have plebitis of left\nupper extremity possibley related to amiodarone infusion. He was\nstarted on PO keflex. In light of starting the antibiotic his\nINR bumped slight and his coumadin was adjusted. This will need\nto be monitored closely while he continues on the antibiotic. He\nhas continued to make steady progress and was ready for\ndischarge on POD #7.
