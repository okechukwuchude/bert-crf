In [**2162**], he had a cardiac catheterization which\nshowed multivessel CAD. He was found to have an occluded RCA, a\n60% LAD lesion and some disease in the marginal vessel. He has\nbeen managed medically since then and had been doing well until\nthis past year when he started to experiencing progressive\ndyspnea with exertion. He describes shortness of breath which\noccurs when he walks outside about one block or after climbing 2\nflights of stairs. He denies any dyspnea at rest. He  had a\nstress MIBI done on [**2172-3-17**] at Dr.[**Name (NI) 9388**] office. He exercised\nfor 6.5 minutes to a heart rate of 100bpm. No significant EKG\nchanges noted. Nuclear imaging was notable for a moderate to\nlarge sized, severe inferolateral posterolateral defect which\nremains fixed.(unchanged from prior MIBI). Given the patient's\nprogression in symptoms, he has now been referred for outpatient\ncardiac catheterization. He was found to have three vessel\ndisease upon cardiac catheterization today and is now referred\nto cardiac surgery for revascularization.\n\nPast Medical History:\nCoronary artery disease s/p Inferior Myocardial Infarction age\n52\nBenign Prostatic Hypertrophy s/p TURP\nSeizure disorder since age 16; last episode about 20 yrs ago\nInferior Myocardial Infarction age 52\nHypertension\nHyperlipidemia\nRheumatic fever as a child age 14\nMacular Degeneration\ns/p Hernia repair\ns/p Left Knee surgery- ACL\ns/p Right Torn rotator cuff repaired\n\nSocial History:\nRace: Caucasain\nLast Dental Exam: 1 year ago\nLives with: Wife\nOccupation: Family Lawyer\n[**Name (NI) 1139**]: quit in [**2125**]\nETOH: occassional small glass of wine\n\nFamily History:\nFather with MI at age 52, Paternal uncle MI at age 53, Maternal\nuncles with [**Name2 (NI) **]\n\nPhysical Exam:\nPulse:54 Resp:18  O2 sat:99/RA\nB/P  Right:170/71    Left:167/75\nHeight:5'8.5\"     Weight:180 lbs\n\nGeneral:NAD, alert and cooperative\nSkin: Dry [s] intact [s]\nHEENT: PERRLA [s] EOMI [s]\nNeck:  Supple [s] Full ROM [s]\nChest: Lungs clear bilaterally [s]\nHeart: RRR [s]  Irregular []  No Murmur\nAbdomen: Soft [x] non-distended [x] non-tender [x]  bowel sounds\n+ [x]\nExtremities: Warm [x], well-perfused [x]  Edema Varicosities:\nNone [x]\nNeuro: Grossly intact\nPulses:\nFemoral      Right: +2  Left:+2\nDP           Right: +2  Left:+2\nPT           [**Name (NI) 167**]: +1  Left:+1\nRadial       Right:+2   Left:+2\n\nCarotid Bruit        Right: none   Left:none\n\nPertinent Results:\n[**2172-4-22**] Echo: Prebypass: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or\ncolor Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular\nhypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.\nRegional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left\nventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There\nare simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic\nvalve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild aortic\nvalve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic\nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-19**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.\nThere is no pericardial effusion.
