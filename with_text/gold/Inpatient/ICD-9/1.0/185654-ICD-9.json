The patient was in her usual state\n   of health until Wednesday [**2-11**], when she developed black diarrhea,\n   occuring 5 times daily. The patient attributes the black color to her\n   iron supplements. Along with diarrhea, the patient also experienced 2\n   episodes of vomiting (clear, no blood or coffee grounds). The patient\n   also had fever to as high as 100.6 on Friday [**2-13**] and Saturday [**2-14**].\n   .\n   On Sunday [**2-15**], the patient became lightheaded when getting up from the\n   toilet and fell, hitting her head and right elbow. She presented to\n   [**Hospital1 1**] [**Location (un) 78**], where head and c-spine CT were negative. She developed\n   chest pain after admission, relieved with metoprolol and nitroglycerin.\n   She received 1 unit of RBCs for Hct 27, and became short of breath. She\n   was given 40mg IV lasix and diuresed 500cc. She ruled in for MI with\n   third set of troponins peaking at 0.26. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 1**]\n   for cardiac catheterization on 100% non-rebreather and a heparin gtt.\n   Of note, pt was guaiac positive on admission.\n   .\n   On arrival to [**Hospital1 1**], the patient was taken to the cardiac catherization\n   lab, where she was found to have severe 3-vessel disease and an\n   elevated LVEDP (see below for details). She was transferred to the CCU\n   on a non-rebreather for further management. In the CCU, the patient was\n   weaned to a non-rebreather. She reported that her breathing was\n   improved and had no other complaints.\n   .\n   On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep\n   venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cough, hemoptysis, or red\n   stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies\n   exertional buttock or calf pain. She denies sore throat, sinus\n   congestion, dysuria. She denies weakness, tingling, or numbness. All of\n   the other review of systems were negative.\n   .\n   Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain and lightheadedness\n   as above and two pillow orthopnea. No syncope.

RBBB. RAD. TWI in III,\n   V1. TWF in aVF.\n   .\n   EKG [**2160-11-12**] (per OMR note): normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 70 with\n   right bundle branch block and upright T-wave, and T-waves in V2-3 which\n   may be considered primary T-wave changes.  She has Q-waves in leads 1,\n   V4-6 and an axis of 90 degrees.  There is no prior tracing to compare\n   to, but she does reportedly have a history of right bundle branch block\n   in the past.  No ischemic changes are seen.\n   .\n   TTE [**2161-2-16**] ([**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 78**]): The left atrium is normal in size. The left\n   atrial volume is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular\n   systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the posterobasal septum and\n   dyskinesis of the adjacent posterior wall. The aortic valve leaflets\n   are mildly thickened (?#). Mild to moderate ([**11-29**]+) aortic regurgitation\n   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe (4+)\n   mitral regurgitation is seen.\n   .\n   TTE [**2160-11-13**]: Mild left atrial enlargement, other chamber sizes are\n   within normal limits. Mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.\n   Left ventricular systolic function estimated 55-60%.  There are no wall\n   motion abnormalities seen.  The aortic valve is mildly calcified with\n   mild aortic insufficiency.  The mitral valve is mildly thickened with\n   moderate mitral regurgitation.  Trace tricuspid regurgitation is seen.\n   There is no evidence of pericardial effusion or intracardiac mass.\n   .\n   ETT: P-MIBI [**2160-11-13**]: No significant focal reversible perfusion defect\n   is seen.  There is decreased perfusion to the inferior wall during\n   stress, which does not improve with rest and is consistent with\n   diaphragmatic attenuation artifact or a small fixed defect.  At rest,\n   the left ventricular ejection fraction is 62%.  At pharmacologic\n   stress, the left ventricular ejection fraction is 63%, which is within\n   normal limits.  No significant regional wall motion abnormality is\n   seen.\n   1. No evidence of focal jeopardized myocardium as described above.\n   2. Normal left ventricular ejection fraction of 63% without significant\n   regional wall motion abnormality at stress.\n   .\n   CARDIAC CATH: [**2161-2-16**]\n   Right dominant\n   LM: distal calcified 30%\n   LAD: diffuse disease throughout to serial 60% lesions just before\n   major D4 with distal 85%; apical 80%; septal collaterals to RPDA\n   LCx: tortuous prox with slow flow, OM prox 50% with tortuous upper\n   pole of OM with mild diffuse disease in AV groove Cx and lower pole of\n   OM with distal AV groove Cx supplying collaterals to the distal\n   RCA system\n   RCA:ostial 40% withous pressure dampening; prox diffuse disease\n   to 75%; distal diffuse dz before RPDA to 45%; moderate diffuse dz\n   throughout RPDA with severe diffuse dz in the distal AV groove\n   RCA supplying the RPLs with slow flow\n   .\n   HEMODYNAMICS:\n   .\n   CT head w/o contrast [**2161-2-15**]: Mild brain atrophy and mild changes of\n   small vessel disease seen. No hemorrhage, mass effect, midline shift or\n   hydrocephalus. Vascular calcifications. IMPRESSION: NO ACUTE\n   INTRACRANIAL ABNORMALITIES.\n   .\n   CT C-spine [**2161-2-15**]: There is no fracture or subluxation seen.  A small\n   calcific density identified between the lamina of C4 and C5 appears to\n   be due to calcification in the ligamentum flavum.  Degenerative changes\n   of facet joints are identified.  Minimal anterolisthesis of C4 over C5\n   and C5 over C6 as well as C7 over T1.  There is no evidence of high\n   grade spinal stenosis seen.  The prevertebral soft tissue thickness\n   ismaintained.

The patient was in her\nusual state of health until Wednesday [**2-11**], when she developed\nblack diarrhea, occuring 5 times daily. The patient attributes\nthe black color to her iron supplements. Along with diarrhea,\nthe patient also experienced 2 episodes of vomiting (clear, no\nblood or coffee grounds). The patient also had fever to as high\nas 100.6 on Friday [**2-13**] and Saturday [**2-14**].\n\nOn Sunday [**2-15**], the patient became lightheaded when getting up\nfrom the toilet and fell, hitting her head and right elbow. She\npresented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**], where head and c-spine CT were\nnegative. She developed chest pain after admission, relieved\nwith metoprolol and nitroglycerin. She received 1 unit of RBCs\nfor Hct 27, and became short of breath. She was given 40mg IV\nlasix and diuresed 500cc. She ruled in for MI with third set of\ntroponins peaking at 0.26. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for\ncardiac catheterization on 100% non-rebreather and a heparin\ngtt. Of note, pt was guaiac positive on admission.\n\nOn arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was taken to the cardiac\ncatherization lab, where she was found to have severe 3-vessel\ndisease and an elevated LVEDP (see below for details). She was\ntransferred to the CCU on a non-rebreather for further\nmanagement. In the CCU, the patient was weaned to a\nnon-rebreather. She reported that her breathing was improved and\nhad no other complaints.\n\nOn review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,\nTIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cough,\nhemoptysis, or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or\nrigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. She denies\nsore throat, sinus congestion, dysuria. She denies weakness,\ntingling, or numbness. All of the other review of systems were\nnegative.\n\nCardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain and\nlightheadedness as above and two pillow orthopnea.

In the right upper lobe as well as in the entire left\nlung, the interstitial markings are increased, there are patchy\nareas of opacities, that are ill-defined and distributed in a\nmainly peribronchial pattern. In addition, a small left basilar\natelectasis and a small left pleural effusion is seen. Overall,\nthe morphology and distribution of the changes suggests\nmultifocal pneumonia rather than pulmonary edema. No evidence of\nright basal changes, no evidence of right-sided pleural\neffusion.\n\nCXR ([**2161-2-20**]) - In comparison with study of [**2-18**], there has been\nplacement of left subclavian PICC line extends to the mid\nportion of the SVC. There has been some decrease in the\nbilateral patchy areas of opacification, most likely consistent\nwith improving pneumonia.\n\nCardiac Cath ([**2161-2-16**]) -\n1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system\ndemonstrated severe three vessel CAD. The LCx was the least\nstenosed and there was no obvious single culprit stenosis. The\nLMCA had distal calcification with a hazy 30% stenosis. The LAD\nwas heavily calcified with diffuse disease throughout with\nserial 60% stenoses just before a major D4 with a distal 85%\nstenosis and an 80% apical stenosis. There was a high D1,\nfunctionally a large septal branch which was patent. A large D2\nand D4 were also patent. The LCx was tortuous proximally with\nslow flow and mild diffuse disease in the AV groove LCx. OM\nbranch had a proximal 50% stenosis with a tortuous upper pole\nand mild diffuse disease in the lower pole. The distal AV groove\nLCx supplied collaterals to the distal RCA system. The RCA was\nheavily calcified with a 40% ostial stenosis without pressure\ndampening. There was proximal diffuse disease up to 75% and\ndistal diffuse disease before the RPDA up to 45%.  There was\nmoderate diffuse disease throughout the RPDA with severe diffuse\ndisease in the distal AV groove RCA supplying the RPLs with slow\nflow (? severe disease vs. competitive flow from collaterals).\nSeptal collaterals from the LAD fill the RPDA.\n2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated RA\npressure\nwith a mean RAP of 9 mmHg. There was severely elevated left\nsided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 29 mmHg. There was\nmoderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension with an SBP of\n160 mmHg. No cardiac index could be calculated as unable to\nfloat PWP catheter beyond RA.\n3. Modest hypoxemia (O2 sat 93% on 15L NRB mask) improved to 96%\nwith the addition of 2L via nasal cannula arguing against\nsignificant shunt physiology.\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:\n1. Severe three vessel CAD.\n2. Severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n85 yo F with HTN, Afib, dCHF, CKD, h/o guaiac-positive stools,\ntransferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for cardiac catheterization in the\nsetting of elevated cardiac enzymes, new focal wall motion\nabnormalities, and worsened MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] to have extensive 3-vessel\ndisease.\n\n# Coronary Artery Disease: Pt noted to have a troponin leak at\nan OSH, with peak of 0.26. Was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac\ncatheterization, which revealed three-vessel disease. Given\nthis, pt is a poor candidate for PCI. After much discussion, pt\ndecided that she would not want cardiac surgery. [**Hospital 49578**]\nmedical management was pursued. During her hospitalization, she\nexperienced episodes of chest discomfort, particularly at night.\nShe did not exhibit any ECG changes during these episodes. Her\nmetoprolol was uptitrated, and she was started on a long-acting\nnitrate for further antianginal activity. By the time of\ndischarge, she had been free of chest pain for several days.\n\n# Acute on Chronic Diastolic HF / Worsened Ritral Regurgitation:\nEcho at OSH showing new focal wall motion abnormalities and\nworsened MR, likely of ischemic etiology. On presentation, she\nwas thought to be hypervolemic. Metoprolol and amlodipine were\ntirated for optimum BP control / afterload reduction. The option\nof mitral valvular surgery was addressed, but the patient was\nnot interested in cardiac surgery. She was diuresed with bolus\nIV lasix, which was converted to PO lasix prior to discharge.\n\n# Pneumonia: CXR performed on [**2161-2-18**] was suspicious for\nmultifocal pneumonia. Pt was initially started on broad-spectrum\ncoverage with vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin. She was noted\nto spike a fever on the night of [**2161-2-18**]; however, she remained\nafebrile after that. She did also have a leukocytosis throughout\nher hospitalization, which was improving at the time of\ndischarge. On [**2161-2-20**], her antibiotics were narrowed to\nlevofloxacin, as she had no positive cultures and appeared\nimproved clinically. Of note, at the time of discharge, she did\ncontinue to have an oxygen requirement, which was likely\nmultifactorial in etiology (see below).\n\n# GI Bleeding: The patient was noted to have guaiac positive\nstools during her hospitalization. She did have one episode of a\nhematocrit drop, for which she received a unit of PRBCs. Her\nhematocrit remained stable after that. She also complained of\nsome episodes of dysphagia, with food getting \"stuck\" in her\nthroat. She states that this has been occuring for some time.\nShe was seen by GI for both of these issues. Further evaluation\nwith a barium swallow was recommended as an outpatient. Further\nwork-up of her GI bleeding should also be pursued as an\noutpatient. Of note, in the setting of this GI bleeding, her\naspirin dose was decreased and her PPI dose was increased. Her\niron was also discontinued.\n\n# Oxygen Requirment: Likely multifactorial in the setting of the\npatient's pneumonia and severe MR.
