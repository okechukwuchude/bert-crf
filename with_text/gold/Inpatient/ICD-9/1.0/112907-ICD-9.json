Upon arrival to the\nhospital, he was hemodynamically stable despite having bright\nred blood/maroon blood per rectum with a stable hematocrit.  His\nvital signs and hematocrit were closely monitored. He was\nreported to have a decreased hematocrit to 25 and received 1\nunit of packed red blood cells.\n\nOn hospital day #2, he underwent a colonoscopy which did not\nvisualized any bleeding source.  He continued to bleed and was\ntransfused 1 unit of blood. A tagged RBC scan was performed,\nwhich was also unsuccessful in appreciating any bleed. Multiple\nunits of packed red blood cells were transfused over the next\ncouple days as his hematocrit continued to drop and rebound post\ninfusion. His bleeding increased from 600cc to 1000cc daily.  A\nleft descending colon bleed was discovered during the latest\ntest and the patient was scheduled for IR embolization the\nfollowing day. Unfortunately the patients bleeding decreased\nover the evening prior to surgery and the IR team was unable to\nvisualize or fix the bleed. Bleeding resumed the following day\nand the acute care service was notified.\n\nOn HD #11, he was taken to the operating room for an extended\nleft hemicolectomy with mobilization of the splenic flexure.\nThe operative course was stable.  He had a 400cc blood loss and\nrequired 275cc of platelets. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain was placed in the\nleft retroperitoneum.  He was extubated after the procedure and\nmonitored in the recovery room.\n\nHis post-operative course has been stable.  On POD #1, his\n[**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube and Foley catheter were removed.  During this\ntime, he had an isolated episode of decreased oxygenation to 82%\non room air.  The patient was encouraged to use the incentive\nspirometer and his oxygen level gradually improved.  He reported\nnausea with emesis on POD #3 and he was made NPO and had the\n[**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube inserted. He was also reported to have an\nisolated episode of hematuria which was though to be related to\nmanipulation of the Foley catheter.  His abdominal distention\ngradually resolved and his and the [**Last Name (un) **]-gastric was removed on\nPOD #6 as well as his Hemovac.   He was introduced to clear\nliquids with advancement to a regular diet. The regular diet\nprogressed well until POD #8, when the patient had a recurrence\nof nausea and vomiting.  A x-ray of the abdomen was done which\nshowed dilated loops of small bowel suggestive of an ileus.  A\n[**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube was inserted, and motility agents added to his\nmedical regimen.\n\nOver the course of the next 1-2 days his symptoms improved and\nthe ng tube was removed. His diet was slowly advanced and he was\nable to tolerate this without any difficulties. At time of\ndischarge he was also having bowel movements.\n\nDuring his hospital course, he was evaluated by physical therapy\nbecause of his long hospitalization and deconditioning. After\nevaluation, recommendations were made for discharge home.\n\nHis vital signs have been stable and he has been afebrile.  He\nhas been tolerated a regular diet.  His pain has been controlled\nwith oral analgesics.  His hematocrit has stabilized at 27. His\nPlavix was resumed on POD #7.  His prior anti-platelet\nmedication,Prasugrel  was discontinued.  Aspirin was resumed on\nPOD #8.   He was discharged to home with instructions to\nfollow-up with the acute care surgery clinic, Cardiology, and\nGastroenterology.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nPreadmissions medications listed are incomplete and require\nfuther investigation.
