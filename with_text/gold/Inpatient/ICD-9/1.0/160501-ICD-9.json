Patient was recently admitted to\n[**Hospital1 18**] with right olecranon osteomyelitis. He has been treated\nfor 1.5 weeks with vancomycin for this infection. Since then he\nreports very little improvement in the infection.\n Patient has history of ventilator-associated pneumonia with\nresistant pseudomonas in recent cultures (sensitive only to\ntobramycin but treated with cefepime with good result) and\nreports that over the last few days he has had increasing SOB\nworse than baseline. In addition he has had increasing\nsecretions. He thinks he may also have been having fevers\n(low-grade). No sick contacts but says this feels like his prior\nPNAs so he came to ED.\n.\n VS on arrival to the ED: T:98.9 HR:122 BP:109/79 RR:22 O2Sat:98\non 5L trach mask.  Reportedly received cefepime and/or levoquin\nin the ED  for history of pseudomonal VAP since already on\nVancomycin for osteomyelitis was covered for MRSA.

Initially started on cipro, cefepime for\nhistory of Pseudomonas pneumonia.  Continued on vanco for\nosotemyelitis and home vent settings for night/day.  No\nmicrobiologic evidence of bacteria from sputum, Legionella\nantigen negative.  Thought likely secondary to Enterococcus\nbacteremia, and cipro, cefepime were discontinued.  Patient's\nsymptoms subjectively improved.\n\n# R Olecranon Osteomyelitis: Increased vancomycin dose initially\ndue to low trough, then switched to daptomycin after\nconsultation with ID as clinically no improvement.  Presumably\nno response to vancomycin.\n\n# Enterococcal bacteremia: Initial blood cultures grew\nEnterococcus and coag neg Staph.  Patient was continued on\ndaptomycin and after extensive discussion with ID the decision\nwas made to continue antibiotic treatment via his picc.  The\nrisks of removing the picc were high as the patient has\ndifficult iv access and requires a long course of iv\nantibiotics.  The patient will follow up with ID on an\noutpatient basis (as he was doing prior to admission for his\nosteomyelitis.)\n\n# Chronic obstructive/restrictive pulmonary disease: Continued\non home dose of prednisone 15mg daily and bactrim prophylaxis\nwith prn nebs and chest PT.  Home regimen of trach mask collar\nand SIMV at night was continued.\n\n# Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] Syndrome:  Home pain medications were continued\nincluding methadone, morphine, baclofen, gabapentin, and\nibuprofen (with holding parameters for somnolence).  Bowel\nregimen prn constipation.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMSIR 60mg QID\nMethadone 40mg TID\nBaclofen 40mgs QAM, 20mg at 11am 20mg at 7pm\nGabapentin 800mg TID\nMotrin 800mg TID with food\nLorazepam 1mg HS\nSingulair daily\nOmprazole daily\nPrednisone 15mg daily (given 60mg in ED)\nAtrovent neb Q4H PRN\nAlbuterol [**Doctor First Name **] Q4H PRN\nPulmicort neb [**Hospital1 **]\n\nPatient also was supposed to have been taking Bactrim DS daily\nfor PCP prophylaxis as he is on chronic daily prednisone;\nhowever this was not on his home medication list.\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

We\nthink this was because your infection in the arm was not treated\nenough and you felt sicker than usual which made you too weak to\ncough well. Your antibiotics were switched to daptomycin (from\nvancomycin). We left in your PICC line because it was very\ndifficult to place and putting in a new one would be riskier\nthan treating your infection through the line. You should\ncontinue to follow along with your infectious disease doctor as\nyou were.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nProvider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1037**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2335**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 457**]\nDate/Time:[**2129-9-28**] 9:50\nProvider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 27625**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 457**]\nDate/Time:[**2129-10-28**] 10:00\n\n\n                             [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Name8 (MD) **] MD [**MD Number(1) 292**]\n\nCompleted by:[**2129-9-23**]"
