ECHO showed\ne/o new systolic heart failure on top of preexisting diastolic\nheart failure and is s/p cardiac catheterization with e/o 50%\nleft main disease, 50% LAD stenosis.\nSince discharge, the patient reports weight gain, as well as\nDOE. He denies orthopnea, PND, palpitations, syncope or\npresyncope. He waited until he was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2178-7-22**]\nwhere he was noted to have elevated JVD and 3+ LE edema. Lasix\nwas switched to torsemide 40mg [**Hospital1 **] with continued spironolactone\n50mg daily.\nWhen he initially presented to [**Hospital1 **], the patient was\nnoted to have change in mental status that was attributed to\nuremia, [**Last Name (un) **], and medication side effect from torsemide. He also\nhad a bandemia of 9% and was initially treated for a potential\nUTI. His CXR showed recurrent right pleural effusion. He was\ntreated for acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart\nfailure with IV lasix but of note this was limited by his BP's.\nWeight prior to discharge from [**Location (un) 620**] 105kg.\nWhile on the [**Hospital1 1516**] service, the patient was being diuresed on\nLasix drip 30 mg/hour, with diuresis limited by increasing\ncreatinine. After discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**], it was thought that\nthe patient could benefit from milronone drip in the setting of\nhaving a Swan placed to measure his wedge and his CO. The\npatient also has an element of systolic failure, which could\nalso be improved with milronone.\nOn transfer to the floor, the patient reports feeling well.\n\nPast Medical History:\nAfib on coumadin\nDiastolic heart failure (EF 60-65%)\nOSA\nGout\nGERD with Barrett's esophagus\nHiatal hernia\nElevated PSA\nErectile dysfunction\ns/p cholecystectomy ([**2172**])\ns/p right hip replacement ([**2170**])\ns/p tailers bunion, fascia release, prosthesis (left foot)\n([**2169**])\ns/p deviated septum repair ([**2168**])\ns/p tailers bunion removal ([**2166**])\ns/p multiple laminectomies ([**2164**], [**2151**], [**2148**])\ns/p tendon repair right arm ([**2145**])\ns/p hemorrhoidectomy ([**2126**])\ns/p pilonidal cyst removal ([**2120**])\ns/p appendectomy ([**2116**])\ns/p bone removal left foot ([**2114**])\ns/p tonsillectomy ([**2106**])\n\n\nSocial History:\nThe patient is married and worked in the import business and\nworked for the navy in the shipyards.

The catheter needs to be\npulled back given that the tip is projecting over distal parts\nof the right pulmonary artery.  An opacity that pre-existed at\nthe bases of the right upper lobe is no longer visible. However,\nthe lung volumes have decreased and a small pleural effusion is\nunchanged at the right lung base.  Unchanged moderate\ncardiomegaly.  The right PICC line is constant in position.\nRENAL ULTRASOUND:\n1.  No hydronephrosis.  Simple bilateral renal cysts.\n2.  Right pleural effusion and trace of ascites seen in the\nright upper\nquadrant.\n3.  Arterial and venous flow is documented within each of the\nkidneys,\nhowever, further Doppler analysis cannot be performed as the\npatient is unable to hold his breath.\nSocial Work:\nFamily has met w/ palliative team and wife expresses that the\nconversation is \"premature\". Pt and wife have not signed DNR and\nstill solidifying long-term plans. Pt, wife and [**Name2 (NI) **] are aware of\nlife expectancy ([**7-21**] mos) and reiterated to SW and physician\nthat Pt is going to optimize highest level of care and the\npriority is to be at home.\n\nPt and family met w/ infusion home care co. as an option for\nnext\nsteps. Physician communicated to pt/family that PT will be\nconsulted on recommendations for home vs rehab.\n\nFamily and Pt are continuing to explore all options and continue\nto look into rehab's that can manage current medications however\nfamily has reiterated that going home is their first preference.\n\nAssessment: Family and Pt is experiencing difficult adjustment\nto\nillness and next steps on the best approach for Pt. SW provided\nempathic listening, guidance on resources that are available,\nand\nencouraged Pt and family to continue to utilize clinicians to\nhelp make an informed decision on where Pt should transition to\nnext.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname 109642**] is 77M with history of atrial fibrillation on\ncoumadin, systolic and diastolic heart failure, cardiac\namylodosis, and multiple myeloma who initially presented from\nOSH with weight gain and need aggressive IV diuresis, requiring\nCCU admission for initiation of milrinone drip.\n.\n# Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: Patient\nwith baseline restrictive disease secondary to his cardiac\namyloid. Also with systolic CHF first seen [**5-21**] with RV free\nwall hypokinesis.  He presented with diffuse peripheral edema,\nworsening abdominal distention and JVP elevated to 12 cm,\nconsistent with right sided failure.  He also presented with\nright pleural effusion that represented transudate [**3-12**] CHF. He\nwas initially diuresed with lasix drip and metolazone with good\neffect, but was stopped after increasing creatinine.  He was\nthen transferred to the ICU for diuresis with milrinone for\ninotropic effect and pulomary vasodilation allowing right sided\nunloading. His right heart pressures were monitored by swan-ganz\ncath with PA pressure 50 to 40s and wedge pressures of 28 to 19\nafter administartion of milrinone.  He diuresed well in the CCU,\nwas transfered to the floor, but after weaning milrinone, he\nrequired reinitiation of milrinone in the CCU due to drop off in\nenergy level, urine output an reaccumulation of fluid.   He\ntolerated reinstitution of milrinone infusion well and was\ntransferred to the floor.  He was also continued spironolactone\nand torsemide after period of autodiuresis from [**Last Name (un) **] ended.  Over\nthe course of the hospitalization he lost about 40lbs.  His\ndischarge weight was roughly equivalent to his dry weight at\n89.1 kg (196 lbs).  He was counseled on the importance of daily\nweights and CHF management.  He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]\nin cardiology clinic.\n.\n[**Last Name (un) **]: Pt developed [**Last Name (un) **] in the setting of aggressive diuresis.\nNephrology was consulted and felt this was likely ATN vs\npre-renal due to hypoperfusion.  It was unlikely a sequelae of\nMM or amyloid as no protein was found in the urine.  After\ndiscontinuing Lasix gtt, he autodiuresed.  Upon discharge, his\nCreatinine returned to his baseline of 1.7.\n.\nCommunity Acquired Pneumonia:  Pt developed cough and\nleukocytosis with CXR findings of right upper lobe infiltrate.\nHe was treated with Ciprofloxacin and then Levofloxacin caused\nhim to have a supratherapeutic INR above 5.
