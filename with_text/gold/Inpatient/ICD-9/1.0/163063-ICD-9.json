At the time of this diagnosis, he was also diagnosed with\n   a renal cell carcinoma for which he underwent unilateral left complete\n   nephrectomy and this was thought to be curative therapy. In late [**Month (only) **]\n   [**2175**], he again felt febrile and repeat CT of the abdomen revealed new\n   or increased adenopathy in the left internal and external iliac groups,\n   the largest area being 24 mm. He also had some liver lesions, which\n   were suspicious for metastatic disease (lymphoma versus renal cell\n   carcinoma) and splenomegaly. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] where he\n   underwent a CT of the torso showing multiple abnormally enlarged lymph\n   nodes in the retroperitoneum,extending to the left common and external\n   iliac chains to the left inguinal ring, highly concerning for recurrent\n   lymphoma. There are multiple ill-defined liver lesions, very\n   symptomatic metastatic disease and small volume ascites. There is a\n   thin band of enhancing soft tissue in the\n   left nephrectomy bed, worrisome for locally recurrent renal cell\n   carcinoma and a cluster of central lobular nodules in the left upper\n   lobe measuring up to 7 mm in size. There was also a 4-mm right lower\n   lobe pulmonary nodule seen. Biopsy of a left iliac lymph node showed\n   involvement by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The MIB fraction was\n   approximately 90%. CD20 was not immunoreactive and this was thought to\n   be due to previous therapy with rituximab and therefore he was started\n   on ICE without Rituxan due to the lack of CD20 positivity in the cells.\n   His therapy was complicated by encephalopathy. He developed asterixis,\n   negative myoclonus, inattentiveness and somnolence after the second\n   dose of ifosfamide and third dose was delayed by one day. His third\n   dose resulted in similar signs. This was cleared within 24 hours, the\n   somnolence improved dramatically\n   within 24 hours as well. He was discharged after this cycle on\n   [**2175-8-26**]. He was readmitted with febrile neutropenia secondary to C.\n   difficile colitis on [**2175-9-4**], treated with oral vancomycin and flagyl,\n   and discharged on [**2175-9-11**]. He was readmitted on [**2175-9-25**] for his second\n   cycle of R+ICE, but found to have c.diff colitis at that time and was\n   discharged to home with po vancomycin. Patient now s/p autologous stem\n   cell transplant [**12/2175**], currently day 41 post transplant.\n   .\n   .\n   Other Past Medical History:\n   1. Diabetes mellitus, type II (diagnosed 10-11 years ago), treated with\n   oral meds until chemotherapy, now on ISS.\n   2.

At the time of this diagnosis, he was also diagnosed with\n   a renal cell carcinoma for which he underwent unilateral left complete\n   nephrectomy and this was thought to be curative therapy. In late [**Month (only) **]\n   [**2175**], he again felt febrile and repeat CT of the abdomen revealed new\n   or increased adenopathy in the left internal and external iliac groups,\n   the largest area being 24 mm. He also had some liver lesions, which\n   were suspicious for metastatic disease (lymphoma versus renal cell\n   carcinoma) and splenomegaly. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] where he\n   underwent a CT of the torso showing multiple abnormally enlarged lymph\n   nodes in the retroperitoneum,extending to the left common and external\n   iliac chains to the left inguinal ring, highly concerning for recurrent\n   lymphoma. There are multiple ill-defined liver lesions, very\n   symptomatic metastatic disease and small volume ascites. There is a\n   thin band of enhancing soft tissue in the\n   left nephrectomy bed, worrisome for locally recurrent renal cell\n   carcinoma and a cluster of central lobular nodules in the left upper\n   lobe measuring up to 7 mm in size. There was also a 4-mm right lower\n   lobe pulmonary nodule seen. Biopsy of a left iliac lymph node showed\n   involvement by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The MIB fraction was\n   approximately 90%. CD20 was not immunoreactive and this was thought to\n   be due to previous therapy with rituximab and therefore he was started\n   on ICE without Rituxan due to the lack of CD20 positivity in the cells.\n   His therapy was complicated by encephalopathy. He developed asterixis,\n   negative myoclonus, inattentiveness and somnolence after the second\n   dose of ifosfamide and third dose was delayed by one day. His third\n   dose resulted in similar signs. This was cleared within 24 hours, the\n   somnolence improved dramatically\n   within 24 hours as well. He was discharged after this cycle on\n   [**2175-8-26**]. He was readmitted with febrile neutropenia secondary to C.\n   difficile colitis on [**2175-9-4**], treated with oral vancomycin and flagyl,\n   and discharged on [**2175-9-11**]. He was readmitted on [**2175-9-25**] for his second\n   cycle of R+ICE, but found to have c.diff colitis at that time and was\n   discharged to home with po vancomycin.

At the time of this diagnosis, he\nwas also diagnosed with a renal cell carcinoma for which he\nunderwent unilateral left complete nephrectomy and this was\nthought to be curative therapy. In late [**2175-7-5**], he again felt\nfebrile and repeat CT of the abdomen revealed new or increased\nadenopathy in the left internal and external iliac groups, the\nlargest area being 24 mm. He also had some liver lesions, which\nwere suspicious for metastatic disease (lymphoma\nversus renal cell carcinoma) and splenomegaly. He was\ntransferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he underwent a CT of the torso\nshowing multiple abnormally enlarged lymph nodes in the\nretroperitoneum,extending to the left common and external iliac\nchains to the left inguinal ring, highly concerning for\nrecurrent lymphoma. There are multiple ill-defined liver\nlesions, very symptomatic metastatic disease and small volume\nascites. There is a thin band of enhancing soft tissue in the\nleft nephrectomy bed, worrisome for locally recurrent renal cell\ncarcinoma and a cluster of central lobular nodules in the left\nupper lobe measuring up to 7 mm in size. There was also a 4-mm\nright lower lobe pulmonary nodule seen. Biopsy of a left iliac\nlymph node showed involvement by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.\n\nThe MIB fraction was approximately 90%. CD20 was not\nimmunoreactive and this was thought to be due to previous\ntherapy with rituximab and therefore he was started on ICE\nwithout Rituxan due to the lack of CD20 positivity in the cells.\n\nHis therapy was complicated by encephalopathy. He developed\nasterixis, negative myoclonus, inattentiveness and somnolence\nafter the second dose of ifosfamide and third dose was delayed\nby one day. His third dose resulted in similar signs. This was\ncleared within 24 hours, the somnolence improved dramatically\nwithin 24 hours as well. He was discharged after this cycle on\n[**2175-8-26**]. He was readmitted with febrile neutropenia secondary\n\nto C. difficile colitis on [**2175-9-4**], treated with oral vancomycin\n\nand flagyl, and discharged on [**2175-9-11**]. He was readmitted on\n[**2175-9-25**] for his second cycle of R+ICE, but found to have c.diff\ncolitis at that time and was discharged to home with po\nvancomycin.\n.\nOther oncologic history:\n- ? Prostate cancer - biopsy on [**2174-8-26**] revealed high-grade\nprostatic intraepithelial neoplasia\n- Renal cell carcinoma - diagnosed [**1-/2175**] after routine work-up\n\nincluding CT scan; s/p nephrectomy (considered curative)\n.\nOther active problems:\n- Pancytopenia\n- Findings on CT [**2175-8-14**] concerning for locally recurrent renal\n\ncell carcinoma, recurrent lymphoma (retroperitoneal nodes\nextending down int/ext iliac chains), lesions in liver (? renal,\n\n? lymphoma mets)\n\n\nSocial History:\nMarried, lives with wife [**Name (NI) **] in [**Location (un) **], [**State 350**]. Two\ndaughters (one works as nurse and lives with him), one son. Was\na motor mechanic but could not tolerate the eczema. For the last\nthirty-five years he has worked as a computer technician, at\nfirst with [**Month (only) **]. Currently on disability. Smoked until [**2144**] (11.5\n\nppd x 13 years) and does not presently drink (x 14 years),\nalthough did have history of heavy EtOH use.\n\n\nFamily History:\nFather died from mesothelioma (worked in fire department and as\njanitor, smoked), and had a pace-maker. Mother had diabetes and\nbreast cancer, still alive with \"lazy blood cancer\". OSH\ndocuments describe his mother's \"myelodysplastic syndrome, 5q\nminus syndrome and low-grade lymphoma involving bone marrow as\nwell as monoclonal gammopathy consulted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 35852**]\".\nHalf-sister (by his mother) with diabetes, obesity and poor\nself-care, is deceased.

No pathologically enlarged mediastinal, mesenteric or\nretroperitoneal lymphadenopathy that would be concerning for\nrecurrence, with marked interval improvement of previously noted\nlymphadenopathy in retroperitoneum and left pelvic region as\nseen on CT from [**2175-8-14**].\n2. Previously noted band of enhancing soft tissue in left\nnephrectomy bed on examinations from [**2175-8-14**] and [**2175-10-23**] is\nincompletely evaluated on this non-contrast examination with no\ngross enlargement.\n3. Slight thickening of the cecum. It is unclear if this is from\nunderdistention, typhlitis, or infection/inflammation.\n\n[**2176-2-5**] Liver/Gallbladeer U/S:\n1. Cholelithiasis again noted within contracted gallbladder.\nPossible sludge also. No biliary obstruction.\n2. Normal liver exam on ultrasound. Again previously seen lesion\nin the liver on CT of [**2175-8-14**] is not visualized on ultrasound.\n\n[**2176-2-11**] MRI ABDOMEN W/O & W/CONTRAST:\n1. No abnormality identified to explain patient's persistent\nfevers. No fluid collections seen.\n2. Diffuse low signal intensity within the liver and spleen is\nconsistent with iron deposition secondary to hemosiderosis.\n3. Massive splenomegaly.\n4. Enhancing linear soft tissue noted within the left\nnephrectomy bed which is unchanged from the recent CT, and again\nremains concering for disease recurrence.\n5. Mildly increased size of a left paraaortic lymph node.\n6. Abnormal marrow signal, possibly related to iron deposition\nbut marrow\ninfiltration by lymphoma, post-treatment changes, or marrow\nreconversion are not excluded.\n\n[**2176-2-13**] CT TORSO W/CONTRAST:\n1. Slight increase in size of subcentimeter mediastinal lymph\nnodes, soft tissue thickening in the left nephrectomy bed, and\nsoft tissue nodules/lymph node in the left paraaortic\nregion,potentially concerning for recurrence of disease.\n2.The spleen has increased by 4 cm in its length since [**1-31**], concerning for worsening of patient's lymphoma.\n3. Two stable pulmonary nodules as described.\n4. Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis, which is new, but\nnot specific.\n5. No intra-abdominal or pelvic collections.\n\n[**2176-2-13**] Head CT W/O CONTRAST: No acute intracranial process. No\nmidline shift.\n\n[**2176-2-18**] CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST:\n1. No significant change in appearance of the right adrenal\ngland with no evidence of high attenuation to suggest\nspontaneous active adrenal hemorrhage.\n2. Overall no significant interval change in appearance of the\nabdomen with the previously noted soft tissue thickening in the\nleft nephrectomy bed and left periaortic region stable, though\nincompletely characterized on this non-contrast examination.\n3. Splenomegaly with spleen measuring up to 22 cm.\n\n[**2176-3-1**]: CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis:\n1. New subtle ground-glass opacities in the bilateral lungs\npredominantly in the bases. Although findings are nonspecific,\ndifferential diagnosis includes edema, infection, or drug\nreaction.\n2. Status post splenectomy with a small amount of fluid within\nthe posterior splenectomy bed and mesenteric stranding. While\nthese findings may represent post-surgical change, and\nunderlying infection is not excluded. Splenic vein thrombus\nwhich does not cross the midline. Portal vein patent.\n3. Interval increase in some of mediastinal and retroperitoneal\nlymph nodes.\n4. Stable 3 mm left lower lobe nodule and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacity.\n5. Enhancing tissue within the left nephrectomy bed very\nsuspicious for RCC recurrence.\n\n[**2176-3-5**]: Bone Marrow Biopsy: HYPERCELLULAR MARROW WITH EXTENSIVE\nINVOLVEMENT BY PATIENT'S KNOWN DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA.\n\n[**2176-3-8**]: Chest Xray: No active disease in the chest.\n\n[**2176-3-4**]: Liver ultrasound: The liver has a normal echotexture\nwithout focal hepatic lesions. There is no intra- or\nextra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation. The common bile duct is\nnormal measuring 4 mm. There are multiple small non-obstructing\ngallstones.  The portal vein is patent with normal hepatopetal\nflow. The patient is status post splenectomy. There is no\nascites.\n\n[**2176-3-12**]: CT chest/abd/pelvis:\n1. Interval organization of fluid within the splenectomy bed,\nnow with\nenhancing rim. infection is not excluded by imaging. Splenic\nvein thrombus has not propagated; portal vein remains patent.\n2. Subtle diffuse ground-glass opacities in bilateral lungs with\nlower lobe predominance, similar to that seen on [**2176-3-1**].\nFindings again nonspecific, with differential including\ninflammatory or infectious processes.\n3. Status post left nephrectomy and adrenalectomy. Stable\nenhancing soft\ntissue within the left nephrectomy bed.\n4. Minimal if any increase in size of retroperitoneal and\nmediastinal lymph nodes.\n5. Multiple tiny lung nodules and peribronchovascular nodular\nopacities,\nsimilar to that seen on [**2176-3-1**].\n\n[**2176-3-13**]: Chest Xray: There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal\ncontours are normal. The lungs are clear. There is no pleural\neffusion. Drain projects in the left upper quadrant.\n\n[**2176-3-19**]: Non-contrast chest CT: 1. Diffuse infectious process,\nlikely viral in origin, with small bilateral pleural effusions.\n2. Slight increase in mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\n3. Soft tissue nodular thickening in the left nephrectomy bed,\nincompletely evaluated due to the lack of IV contrast.\n\n[**2176-3-21**] BAL Cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Numerous\npulmonary macrophages, bronchial cells, lymphocytes and\nbenign-appearing squamous cells.\n\n[**2176-3-22**] Portable CXR: Widespread ground-glass opacities are\npresent throughout both lungs with some associated reticular,\nmicronodular, and linear opacities. Heart size and pulmonary\nvascularity have not appreciably changed. Correlation with chest\nCT of [**2176-3-19**] demonstrates widespread abnormalities which\nhave apparently progressed. Observed findings are likely due to\nan evolving infection, either viral or pneumocystis.\n\n[**2176-3-22**] CT Abd/Pelvis: 1. Marked interval progression of\nbilateral ground-glass opacity and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in the\nlung bases with small bilateral pleural effusions concerning for\nworsening infectious disease process.\n2. Interval decrease in fluid collection within the left upper\nquadrant with drain in appropriate position. Other areas of\nsmall amount of fluid within the perihepatic space along the\nright paracolic gutter are now identified.\n3. Mild gallbladder distention, unchanged. Periportal edema,\nsimilar in appearance.\n4. Enhancing nodule within the left nephrectomy surgical bed\nconcerning for recurrence.\n5. Multiple pathologically enlarged lymph nodes within the\nretroperitoneum, unchanged.\n6. Focal areas of wall thickening involving the cecum and\nsigmoid colon.\nDedicated visualization with colonoscopy is recommended given\nhistory of\nlymphoma.\n7. Persistant splenic vein thrombosis.\n\n[**2176-3-23**] Portable CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph,\nthe bilateral parenchymal opacities have further increased in\nextent and severity. The distribution and morphology of the\nopacities would be consistent with diffuse infection, or\nvascular permeability edema. Increasing retrocardiac\natelectasis, no evidence of pleural effusions.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n59 year old male with a history of Type II DM, high-grade\nprostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, renal cell carcinoma s/p L\nnephrectomy ([**1-/2175**]), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ([**1-/2175**])\ns/p autologous SCT admitted for febrile neutropenia.\n\n#. Febrile neutropenia: There was initially no clear source\nbased on cultures or imaging. He was started on vancomycin,\ncefepime, levoquin, and tamiflu. Nasopharyngeal swab and culture\nwere negative for viral infection, so the tamiflu was\ndiscontinued. He continued to have fevers to 103 so micafungin\nwas added for fungal coverage while invasive marker of fungal\ninfection were sent. Bone marrow biopsy on [**2-2**] did not show\ndisease recurrence.  There was concern for hepatic candidiasis\ngiven increased alk phos but hepatic MRI was negative. He\ncontinued to spike fevers to 103 degrees, with no positive\nculture data. PET/CT on [**2-16**] showed a massive, FDG avid spleen\n(22cm up 4cm since [**2176-1-31**]) and some FDG-avid nodes, concerning\nfor disease recurrence. He required daily platelet and blood\ntranfusions, thought to be [**2-6**] to splenic consumption.  General\nsurgery was consulted, and the patient underwent splenectomy on\n[**2176-2-20**] (see below for course with general surgery). He was\ninitially afebrile but again developed fevers on [**2-28**]. CT torso\non [**2-29**] showed new subtle ground-glass opacities bilaterally,\npredominantly in the bases.  He received pentamidine on [**3-2**] for\nPCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]. Blood, urine, stool, and mycolytic cultures\ncontinued to be negative. Repeat CT's on [**3-19**] and [**3-22**] showed\nworsening intrapulmonary processes, reported as likely\ninfectious. Antibiotic coverage was broadened to include\ndaptomycin, zosyn, voriconazole, levaquin, and bactrim. The\npatient underwent bronchoscopy/bronchoalveolar lavage on [**3-21**]\nand repeat on [**2176-3-24**], both negative for organisms or PCP;\nbactrim was then discontinued on [**3-24**]. The only culture positive\ndata was from his JP drain fluid, which grew enteroccoccus; ID\nfelt this was more consistent with colonization than infection,\nbut the patient was nonetheless continued on Daptomycin.  He was\ntranfused PRBCs and platelets to keep his HCt above 25 and his\nplatelets above 10. Sputum culture on [**3-25**] grew GNRs, likely\nrespiratory flora, but given persistent fevers, ID recommended\nchanging levofloxacin to gentamicin, and zosyn to meropenem.\nCXR and CT chest were consistent with progression of the\npatient's underlying lymphoma, and although he continued to be\ntreated for infectious source, B lymphoma symptoms were also\nconsidered as contributing to his fevers. Ultimately, he could\ncontinued to spike fevers with hypotension despite negative\ncultures. Antibiotics were being changed to meet this fever\ncurve, with the last major addition being daptomycin on [**4-3**].\nDespite this, his CXR continued to reveal new opacities. This\ntogether with his fevers and history of recurrent lymphoma\npresenting with fevers, comfirmed a primary role for lymphoma.\nOn [**4-4**], a family meeting was held wherein the patient would be\nmade DNR and a transition to comfort care was initiated. He\npassed shortly thereafter\n\n#. Respiratory distress: As above, the patient had worsening\nopacities on chest films and CT scans, concerning for infection.\nAfter his bronchoscopy on [**3-21**], the patient was breathing\ncomfortably and satting well, intermittently wearing 1-2 liters\nby nasal cannula. The following day, he was found to be\ntachypnic, and ABG revealed PO2 of 69. On the morning of [**3-23**],\nhe triggered for worsening hypoxia, tachypnea, and tachycardia.\nHe was placed on a non-rebreather mask. ABG revealed O2 of ~100,\nwhile on the NRB. Stat chest x-ray revealed worsening opacities.\nHe was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.  On\narrival patient was tachypneic and tachycardic, and was\nintubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.  Bronchoscopy\nwas performed which was negative x 2.  Bactrim was stopped, but\nhe was otherwise continued on broad spectrum antibiotics.\nThoracic surgery declined to perform a VATS biopsy given\npatients comorbidities.\n\n#. Abdominal pain: The patient complained of the acute onset of\nabdominal pain on [**3-28**]. CT abd/pel showed small peri-pancreatic\nfluid accumulations. Concern was raised regarding whether or not\nthis was a leak secondary to his surgery.  Surgery recommended\nwatchful waiting.\n\n#. Acute Renal Failure: His creatinine on admission was elevated\nfrom baseline creatinine. This was though to be likely due to\ndehydration and increased insensible loss. He was given IVF in\nthe emergency department and on the floor and his creatinine\nreturned to baseline.\n\n#. Cholestasis Transaminitis: Patient developed an elevated\nalkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and GGT following initiation of\nantibiotic therapy.  Azithromycin was stopped and the LFTs\nimproved.  There was no sign of hepatitic candidiasis.  He later\nagain had elevated transaminitis and elevated alk phos with a\nnormal bilirubin.  Tylenol was kept to a minimum and hepatotoxic\ndrugs were stopped.  It was felt that his elevated LFTs may be\ndue to his recurrent lymphoma.\n\n#. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: He is s/p autologous SCT. He\nwas started on antibiotics on admission but after his infectious\nwork-up was negative they were discontinued given concern for\ndrug fever. He had a PET/CT, as above. After splenectomy on\n[**2-20**], splenic tissue showed involvement by non-Hodgkin lymphoma,\ndiffuse large B-cell type.  He was restarted on rituxan and\nsteroids on [**2-29**].  He had a BM biopsy on [**2176-3-5**] which showed\ndiffuse involvement by his known lymphoma.  He underwent treated\nwith nitrogen mustard on [**2176-3-7**].\n\n#. Post-operative Splenectomy Course: On [**2176-2-20**], the patient\nunderwent open splenectomy, exploratory laparotomy, and lysis of\nadhesions. After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the\npatient was transferred to the TICU overnight and intubated. The\npatient was hemodynamically stable. He was extubated on POD#1,\nand later transferred to the floor.  Post-operative pain was\ncontrolled with the a Dilaudid PCA.  JP amylase was sent in the\nevening of POD#6; the JP was discontinued on POD#7 as the output\nand amylase level were low.  Around POD 20-21, he began to\ncomplain of left-sided abdominal pain.  CT abdomen/pelvis was\ndone which showed an fluid collection at the splenectomy site\nwith an enhancing rim and there was concern for infection given\nhis recent fevers.  This collection was drained by\ninterventional radiology and gram stain and culture were\nnegative to date.  The fluid did have a very elevated amylase\nlevel which suggested pancreatic fistula/injury during the\nsurgery.
