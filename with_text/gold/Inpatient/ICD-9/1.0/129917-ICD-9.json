Per the last [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] admission note:\n   .\n   She initially represented to the surgical service on [**9-9**] with\n   fever/chills and shortness of breath and empirically covered with\n   zosyn/flagyl. A large R pleural effusion was discovered and she\n   underwent thoracentesis [**9-12**] which to date has shown no growth on cx.\n   Subsequently, CT scan [**9-11**] of her abdomen was unrevealing, but pt had\n   persistent leukocytosis despite broad spectrum abx, repeat CT abdomen\n   was performed and showed free fluid under the diaphragm and at the\n   anastomotic site. At that time ([**Date range (1) 1905**]) she underwent IR guided\n   drain placement of the fluid collections and vancomycin was added to\n   her regimen. Despite the above procedures, she continued to have a\n   rising WBC count and it was decided to take her to the OR for more\n   complete washout and ileostomy to divert fecal stream. Intraoperatively\n   she was found to have significant leakage at prior anastomosis site as\n   well as 300cc EBL and approx 1.5L of ascites. In addition to the loop\n   ostomy, a large drain was placed at this site.  During the procedure,\n   she received 2u pRBCs, 4u FFP, and 1600cc crystaloid.\n   .\n   Her surgical procedure was complicated by acute renal failure likely\n   secondary to hypotension and inadequate renal perfusion with an initial\n   increase in creatinine to 2.3 from a baseline of 0.9-1.  During her\n   [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] admission, she was extubated successfully and transferred to the\n   surgical service.  Initial path results of the cecal mass were\n   consistent with low grade B cell lymphoma.\n   .\n   Since transfer the floor, the patient was initially stable but has over\n   the past day developed a worsening leukocytosis to 62k from 38k, as\n   well as hypotension with SBP in the 90s with HR 110.  She was also\n   noted to have sudden anemia with a hct of 17.9 from 28.8 requiring 2u\n   PRBC, as well as a coagulopathy with an INR of 1.7 requiring 1u FFP.\n   In addition, she has had decreased UOP.  She was afebrile but with a\n   more distended abdomen.  Of note, the patient has also been noted to\n   have increasing ostomy output.

[**2177-9-5**] Exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, hand-sewn 2\nlayer side to side ileotranverse colostomy.\n2. [**2177-9-19**] Exploratory laparotomy, LOA, drainage and washout of\nabdomen, diverting loop ileostomy\n3. [**2177-9-27**] Evacuation of pelvic hematoma\n4. [**2177-9-29**] Abdominal closure\n.\nNeuro: She required prn narcotics for pain.  On [**9-24**] her pain\nmedications were discontinued due to increased lethargy.  Her\npain improved and was well controlled on tylenol.  She did\nappear depressed at times but as her strenght improved so did\nher affect and willingness to ambulate and participate in her\ncare.\n\nCardiovascular:  She required vasopressor support\npost-operatively.  This was able to be weaned to off after a\ncouple of days.  She did remain tachycardic in the low 100s\nduring her entire hospital stay.  She was started on a beta\nblocker and her heart rate improved.\n\nPulmonary:  A right thoracentesis was performed on [**2177-9-12**].\nPost-operatively she required ventilatory support.  After her\nthird operation she was volume overloaded and remained on the\nventilator while she was aggressively diuresed.  When she was\nback to her dry weight she tolerated extubation and has remained\nstable from a respiratory standpoint since.  Due to her\npersistent tachycardia a CTA of her chest was obtained, which\nrevealed no pulmonary embolus.\n\nGastrointestinal: She underwent a right colectomy with a\nhand-sewn ileotransverse colostomy on [**2177-9-5**].  Her clinical\nstatus improved initially but then slowly began to deteriorate.\nThis decline along with a substantial leukocytosis prompted a CT\nscan on [**9-15**] which revealed a large abdominal fluid collection\nsurrounding the anastomotic site.  CT guided drainage of this\ncollection was performed.  A repeat CT scan was obtained on\n[**9-16**] and showed two smaller intra-abdominal fluid collections\nthat were percutaneously drained.  A repeat CT scan on [**9-18**]\nshowed a new LLQ fluid collection which was percutaneously\ndrained with a pigtail catheter and the current RUQ drain was\nexchanged.  Her clinical condition failed to improve so on [**9-19**]\nshe returned to the operating room for an exploratory\nlaparotomy, diverting ileostomy and penrose placement around the\nanastamotic site.  The diverting ileostomy began to function on\n[**9-23**].  On [**9-26**] she became increasingly oliguric.  A CT scan\nshowed a large hematoma compressing both ureters and causing\nhydronephrosis.  She was taken back to the operating room for a\nhematoma evacuation.  She returned to the operating [**Apartment Address(1) **] days\nlater for abdominal packing removal and abdominal closure with\nmesh.  She required TPN support for nutrition.  She developed\npancreatitis and an elevated bilirubin.  The elevated bilirubin\nwas attributed to TPN and cholestasis, and has been trending\ndown to near normal.  Due to her pancreatitis, a Dobhoff tube\nwas placed and tube feeds started.  Her lipase remain elevated\nfor a number of days and has since trended back down towards\nnormal.  Her TPN was able to be weaned off.  She is currently\ntolerating tube feeds cycled overnight.  Her staples were\nremoved and her incision is healing nicely.  The penrose drain\nwas backed out 4cm and restitched to the ostomy appliance, this\nwill remain to ostomy bag drainage.\n\nGenitourinary: On [**9-18**] her serum creatinine rose to 1.5 and she\nwas bolused with IVF for low urine output.  After her 2nd\noperation, her creatinine continued to rise.  A renal consult\nwas obtained and they felt that her acute renal failure was due\nto ATN.  On [**9-26**] she became increasinly oliguric and was\ntransferred back to the ICU.  A repeat CT scan showed a large\npelvic hematoma which was compressing the ureters and causing\nhydronephrosis.  This hematoma was evacuated and her renal\nfunction has returned to [**Location 213**].  While she was in acute renal\nfailure, her medications were renally dosed.\n\nFEN: She was advanced to a regular diet post-operatively.  When\nshe was found to have an anastomotic leak she was made NPO, a\nPICC line was placed, and TPN was started on [**9-17**].  She became\nhypernatremic on [**9-24**] which was treated with D5W to replace her\nfree water deficit.  Due to increased ostomy output at times,\nshe has required free water boluses per her Dobhoff tube.  These\nfree water boluses can be continued as needed.  Imodium may also\nbe added to her medication regimen to help control her ostomy\noutput.\n\nHeme: She has had recurrent issues of leukocytosis, anemia, and\nthrombocytopenia.  Her initial leukocytosis was attributed to\nsepsis, which resolved with antibiotics and drainage of abscess\ncollections.  Her recurrent bouts of leukocytosis were thought\nto be consistent with a leukemoid reaction.  Her WBC is trending\ndownward and is now at a low of 18K.  She has ongoing problems\nwith anemia secondary to her myelodysplastic syndrome.  She\nreceived transfusions of packed RBCs when necessary.\n\nID: After the initial operation she had a persistent\nleukocytosis so she was started on empiric Zosyn and Flagyl.\nVancomycin was added on [**9-15**] when a peri-anastomotic collection\nwas found.  With her impressive leukocytosis, multiple stool\nsamples were sent for C.diff, which all were negative.\nFluconazole was added on [**9-18**].  A 10 day course of Vancomycin\nwas complete for coag negative staph isolated from a blood\nculture.  A 9 day course of Meropenem was completed for\nEnterobacter that was grown from the pigtail catheter.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nVicodin and colace.

To OR yesterday where abdomen was unpacked and wound closed.\n   A-line came out overnight. Overnight hct dropped to 21 without evidence\n   of increased output from surgical drains.  Weaned off pressors at 5 am\n   albeit given hemodynamic lability needed to go back on at 0945 just\n   prior to our rounding.  Low grade fevers overnight.

Anasarca increased.\n   Unresponsive even to noxious stimuli, have decreased fentanyl and\n   versed as suspect she is oversedated.  Labs notable for WBC 72, plts\n   100K, INR 1.7.  No new culture data.\n   Problems:\n   1)       Chronic respiratory failure secondary to volume overload.  Has\n   had secretions, mostly described as frothy albeit today more thick,\n   tan.  Bronchoscopy showed minimal frothy secretions throughout, BAL\n   clear sent for gram stain, C+S as per surgery. Continues broad spectum\n   abx/antifungal therapy. Need to readdress with ID service as to\n   endpoint.  Try to diurese with blood transfusions today if blood\n   pressure will tolerate.  Needs a-line replaced as this came out\n   overnight.\n   2)       Anemia:  No clear evidence of blood loss in abdomen given\n   drains not producing much output.  Will give FFP to maintain INR <1.5.\n   Plts up to 100K.  Follow serial CBC, if trending down will obtain\n   repeat CT of the abdomen.\n   3)       Hypotension secondary to hypovolemia vs. sepsis:  Managing\n   with IVF challenge, transfuse pRBCs as above given hct drop, continues\n   broad spectum abx.\n   4)       Acute renal failure secondary to hematoma/obstruction and\n   component of ATN related to episodes of hypotension.
