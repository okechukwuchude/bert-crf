No spontaneous\necho contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium\nor left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen\nin the body of the right atrium. Left ventricular wall\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is\nnormal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal\n(LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated\nwith normal free wall contractility. There are simple atheroma\nin the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the\ndescending thoracic aorta. There is severe aortic valve stenosis\n(valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is\nmoderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nPOST CPB:\n1.Preserved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function\n2. A bioprosthetic valve is identified in aortic position. Well\nseated and good leaflet excursion. Np AI. Peak transvslvular\ngradient of 45 mm Hg, with carfiac output = 6.5 liters/min.\n3. MR is now mild.\n4.
