She was sent here from [**Hospital3 2558**] rehab for\nspiking fevers with chills and hypotension as well as having\npulled her PICC line partway out. It was removed, the tip was\ncultured (negative final culture) and blood Cx's were drawn\n(NGTD at time of d/c, still pending). She was transferred to the\nMICU for concerns of hypotension with BP's in the 90's (which is\nabout her her baseline according to the patient) where she\nbecame afebrile and her pressures stabilized after fluids. In\nthe MICU it was discovered that 4/5 blood cultures from [**Hospital1 2025**] on\n[**7-14**] and [**7-15**] were positive for Gordonia species. ID was\nconsulted and she was re-started on her IV vancomycin. It was\nthought that this represented a line infection at [**Hospital1 2025**] and that\nthe line had been discontinued and that she had recieved at\nleast 2 weeks of IV vancomycin which is adequate treatment for\nsuch an infection. She refused various elements of the work-up\nincluding a physical exam on transfer to the floor, urine\ncultures, echocardiogram to evaluate for possible endocarditis,\nbone scan, and other further imaging. Her course was marked by\ndaily fever spikes (as high as 103 on this admission) including\na spike to 101.3 the morning of the day of discharge which she\ndescribed as her baseline for several years when in the\nhospital, in rehab, or at home. She indicated on numerous\noccasions her desire to avoid further workup and to return to\n[**Hospital3 2558**] for rehab despite spiking fevers, even\nthreatening to leave AMA if need be on several occasions. She\nremained hemodynamically stable throughout her admission and\nagreed to keep her follow-up appointments at [**Hospital1 2025**] with infectious\ndisease (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2855**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who prescribes and manages her\nvancomycin and to whom all management questions should be\ndirected: [**Hospital1 2025**], [**Street Address(2) 38740**] [**Location (un) 86**], [**Numeric Identifier 18228**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 38741**],\nappt on [**8-18**]), orthopaedic surgery (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 38742**] [**Name (STitle) **], appt on\n[**9-8**]), and GI for repeat EGD (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 38743**] [**Name (STitle) **], appt on [**9-8**]).\n.\nCHRONIC DIAGNOSES:\n.\n#Chronic Pain: This issue remained stable during her admission.\nShe was continued on her outpatient pain regimen with the\nexception of an increase in her PO dilaudid dose to 4mg PO Q3hrs\nPRN for breakthrough pain. She was discharged on her home dose\nof dilaudid of 2mg PO Q3hrs PRN.\n.\n# Anemia: This pt states she has anemia likely of chronic\ndisease as a result of chronic osteomyelitis. She currently does\nnot have an PCP as she is new to [**Location (un) 86**]. It is important for her\nto establish a PCP and undergo workup for her anemia including\ncolonoscopy and GYN evaluation.\n.\n#Lupus Cerebritis with related seizure disorder: She remained\nstable and exhibited no seizure activity on her home Keppra\ndose. We would recommend follow-up with her PCP once established\nor her neurologist\n.\n#GERD: Stable during this admission, continued on her home\nprilosec.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n\nThis patient needs to maintain her follow-up appointments with\ninfectious disease, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2855**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who prescribes and manages\nher vancomycin and to whom all management questions should be\ndirected: [**Hospital1 2025**], [**Street Address(2) 38740**] [**Location (un) 86**], [**Numeric Identifier 18228**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 38741**],\nappt on [**8-18**], orthopaedic surgery Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 38742**] [**Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 2025**], appt\non [**9-8**], and GI for repeat EGD with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 38743**] [**Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 2025**] with\nher appt on [**9-8**].
