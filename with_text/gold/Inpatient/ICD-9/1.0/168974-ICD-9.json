S/p colonoscopic decompression with\n  some improvement but volvulus likely still present.\n REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:\n  therapeutic barium enema for volvulus\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n HISTORY:\n Sigmoid volvulus.\n\n TECHNIQUE:\n Single contrast barium enema\n\n COMPARISON:\n Comparison is made to abdominal radiographs taken earlier the same day.\n\n FINDINGS:\n Initial frontal abdominal radiograph shows a dilated loop of sigmoid colon, to\n ~16 cm with a rectal tube in place, traversing the area of dilation and\n terminating in the left lower quadrant near the more proximal sigmoid colon.\n\n Under fluoroscopic observance, barium was instilled into the pre-existing\n rectal tube under gravity. Contrast filled the dilated loop of sigmoid colon,\n though did not pass caudal to an area near the rectosigmoid junction, ~15 cm\n proximal to the anus.  This area shows a twisting mucosal fold pattern,\n consistent with sigmoid volvulus.  More proximally, the lumen of the sigmoid\n narrowed abruptly in the left lower quadrant near the tip of the rectal tube\n and then reconstitutes in the left mid-abdomen, more proximally.  At this area\n of luminal narrowing, the mucosal fold pattern was disrupted laterally and a\n central ulceration was seen within the filling defect, overall suggesting a\n large ulcerated mass.  No other filling defect or strictures were seen.  A\n final frontal radiograph was taken following drainage of the instilled barium,\n and contrast was seen to have passed up to the splenic flexure with the\n superior portion of the abdomen excluded from the field of view.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n 1.  Distal sigmoid volvulus with likely organoaxial rotation, and rectal tube\n traversing the site of the volvulus.\n 2.  Large ulcerated filling defect in the mid-portion of the sigmoid colon\n with associated luminal narrowing, suggestive of an ulcerated mass, concerning\n for malignancy.\n\n These findings were discussed over the telephone with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1036**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2466**]\n at the time of interpretation.\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2151-1-5**] 11:12 AM\n COLON (BARIUM ENEMA)                                            Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 50660**]\n Reason: therapeutic barium enema for volvulus\n Admitting Diagnosis: VOLVULUS\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n\n"
