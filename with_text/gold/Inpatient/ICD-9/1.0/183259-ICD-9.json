Was carrying a table\n   down the steps, and fell backwards. He hit his head on the\n   ground, and the table landed on his abdomen. At OSH, he was\n   originally A&Ox3 and followed commands, but began to develop\n   increasing abdominal pain and respiratory distress. His head CT\n   demonstrated a reported IPH, however, the patient came without a\n   CT report or a disk. He was intubated for transport. Upon\n   arrival to the ED, he was hypoxic and hypotensive. He had b/l chest\n   tubes placed for b/l pneumothoraces which initially put out 600cc of\n   blood on the R and 100cc on the L. His fast exam was postitive for\n   blood in the spleno-renal space and [**Location (un) **] pouch. He was given 4U\n   PRBC, 2U FFP, and 8L NS in the ED for hypotension with systolic blood\n   pressures between 60 and 80. His blood pressure initially improved but\n   he then became hypotensive and his repeat HCt was down to 17 (from\n   initial Hct 30 at OSH). He was noted to have brown guiac positive stool\n   on rectal exam. He was found to have a small R IPH, multiple\n   intra-abdominal injuries as well as multiple rib fractures on the R\n   with flail chest and the plan was made to bring him to the OR, however\n   the family elected instead for conservative management. He was made\n   DNR/DNI and brought to the TSICU for further resuscitation.

He was transfused 4 units blood and 2\nFFP in the ED. He was also given 11L crystalloid.  On imaging,\nthe patient was found to have extensive serious traumatic\ninjuries. There was active mesenteric bleeding with hematoma and\nevidence of early small bowel ischemia, retroperitoneal active\nbleeding, likely low grade pancreatic injury, blateral\npneumathoraces with indwelling chest tubes and likely right\nlower lobe contusion and/or aspiration (#5), iatrogenic injury\nresulting inactive bleeding in the R adductor musculature (#7),\nunstable extension distracton injury at T9-T10 and numerous\nother spinal fractures, right\nflail chest, and evidence of hypovlemia.  He was en route to the\noperating room when the family decided to forego surgery.  He\nwas then transferred to the trauma ICU, where he was given 4\nmore units of PRBCs, 2 units of FFP, and 5L crystalloid before\nbeing made CMO.  He was out on a fentanyl/dilaudid drip and\ntaken off the vent. His oxygen saturation and blood pressure\nfell quickly over the next hours, and he expired at 1:42am,\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1.
