Significant\naortic valve\ncalcification is present. Calcification of the left anterior\ndescending\nartery is present. Minor pericardial thickening is noted. The\nmediastinal\nstructures are otherwise normal with normal retrosternal space.\nNo enlarged\nmesenteric lymph nodes.\n\nMinor pleural thickening is noted along the right lateral margin\nadjacent to\nthe right lower lobe with associated pleural bands, likely\nrelated to a\nprevious effusion. The lung parenchyma is otherwise normal.\n\nIn the upper abdomen, nonobstructive calculi are noted in both\nkidneys.\nPancreatic atrophy is also present. Bone review demonstrates\nsignificant\ndegenerative changes. There is loss of height of T11, likely an\nold wedge\ncompression fracture.\n\nIMPRESSION: The ascending aorta is dilated measuring 5.2 cm.\nAortic valve\ncalcification.\n\nThe study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.\n\n[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT\n[**Known lastname 89682**], [**Known firstname **]       [**Hospital1 18**] [**Numeric Identifier 89683**] (Complete)\nDone [**2134-1-18**] at 12:28:00 PM      FINAL\nReferring Physician     [**Name9 (PRE) **] Information\n[**Name9 (PRE) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] R.\n[**Hospital1 18**], Division of Cardiothorac\n[**Hospital Unit Name 4081**]\n[**Location (un) 86**], [**Numeric Identifier 718**]  Status: Inpatient DOB: [**2070-10-6**]\nAge (years): 63 M  Hgt (in): 69\nBP (mm Hg): 134/67  Wgt (lb): 253\nHR (bpm): 78  BSA (m2): 2.28 m2\nIndication: Aortic valve disease.

The rhythm appears\nto be atrial fibrillation. Results were personally reviewed with\nthe MD caring for the patient.\nConclusions\nPrebypass\n\nPrebypass study performed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 168**].\nNo spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of\nthe left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal\ndefect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate\nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular\ncavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic\nfunction is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40% %). The right\nventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free\nwall function. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus\nlevel. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The number of\naortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve\nleaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical\naortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate\n([**11-22**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets\nare mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.\nThere is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in\nperson of the results on [**2134-1-18**] at 1130am.\n\nPost bypass\nPost bypass study performed by Dr [**First Name (STitle) 1510**]\n[**Name (STitle) **] is AV paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine.\nLVEF=40%. Mechanical valve seen in the aortic position. The\nvalve appears well seated and the leaflets move well. Washing\njets typical for this type of valve is seen. Peak gradient\nacross the valve is 10 mm Hg and the mean gradient is 3 mm Hg.\nDr [**Last Name (STitle) **] aware of post bypass findings.\n  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance\nwith HCFA regulations.\n\nElectronically signed by [**Name6 (MD) 1509**] [**Name8 (MD) 1510**], MD, Interpreting\nphysician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2134-1-18**] 16:38\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2134-1-17**] for Heparin bridge\npreoperatively. The patient was brought to the operating room on\n[**2134-1-18**] where the patient underwent aortic valve replacement and\nascending graft were performed with 14 minutes of circulatory\narrest. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and\npost-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable\ncondition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  POD 1 found the\npatient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.\n The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically\nstable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support.  Beta\nblocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward\nthe preoperative weight. CTs and wires were removed on POD 1 and\n2 respectively without complication and Coumadin begun on POD 1\nfor mechanical aortic valve and atrial fibrillation. The patient\nwas transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.\nThe patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for\nassistance with strength and mobility. On POD 4, the patient\nwent into rapid atrial fibrillation. This was treated with\namiodarone and he converted to sinus rhythm. It was noted that\nthe sternal incision had some serosanguinous drainage but no\nerythema which resolved on its own by the following day without\nintervention. By the time of discharge on POD 6 the patient was\nambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled\nwith oral analgesics. His INR was therapeutic at 2.0 on day of\ndischarge. The patient was discharged [**2134-1-24**] in good condition\nwith appropriate follow up instructions.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\n***Coumadin 5 mg MWFSat and 7.5mg TuesThurSun***\nPravachol 20mg daily\nAcetaminophen 975mg prn\nVitamin D 1000 untis daily\nZantac 150mg qhs\nFlucocinonide cream\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. ranitidine HCl 150 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*1*\n2.
