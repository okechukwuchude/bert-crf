Torsemide to be restarted\non discharge.\n\n# Coronary artery disease. [**Hospital1 **] discontinued. Aspirin\nrestarted three days prior to discharge with subsequent stable\nhematocrit. Statin continued. Metoprolol restarted two days\nprior to discharge, and lisinopril to be restarted as\noutpatient.\n\n# Chronic systolic heart failure. Well-compensated throughout\nthe admission. Change in x-ray demonstrated accumulation of mild\nbilateral pulmonary effusions (diuresis was held during the\nadmission). I's/O's closely monitored, and he remained euvolemic\nthroughout the admission. Beta blocker restarted during\nadmission, torsemide to start as outpatient, and lisinopril to\nbe restarted within one week of discharge.\n\n# Delirium. Noted to have reversed sleep/wake cycles during the\nadmission, with subsequent confusion. Improved with trazodone,\nto be continued on discharge.\n\n# Gout flare. On [**5-6**], patient had low-grade fever and\nbilateral great toe pain. Given one dose of colchicine with\nresolution of fever and pain.\n\n# Hyperlipidemia. Continued statin.\n\n# Hypernatremia.
