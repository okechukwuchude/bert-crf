She\nreceived 6L of IV fluids in the ED prior to arrival to MICU with\nresolution of hypotension, supporting a diagnosis of\nhypovolemia.  No source of infection was identified and the\npatient maintained good urine output. Blood pressure remained at\nhome SBP of 90-110 for the remainder of admission, as the\npatient had improved PO intake.\n.\n# Acidemia: On admission, patient had combined AG acidosis, NAG\nacidosis and respiratory acidosis. AG acidosis likely lactate\n(admission lactate of 6.3)/ETOH ketosis (trace ketones on u/a),\nhyperchloremic NAG from NS volume resuscitation. Respiratory\ndepression likely related to hypoventilation in setting of\nbenzodiazepine administration while intoxicated with PCO2 of 44\non ABG. Patient's lactate and pH improved in MICU.\n.\n# Elevated Lactate:  Likely in setting of significant\nhypovolemia and EtOH consumption. Evidence of acidemia on ABG.\nImproved with volume resuscitation.\n.\n# EKG changes: Pt presented with ST depressions in anterolateral\nchest leads and inferolateral limb leads. Could represent\nchanges due to hypokalemia or hypoglycemia. Repeat EKG on HD #2\nshowed resolution of all ST depressions s/p correction of\nelectrolyte abnormalities.\n.\n# Hypoglycemia: Likely due to poor intake while drinking.\nPatient initially given D5 in ED and quickly normalized.\nSubsequent FS WNL.\n.\n# Alcohol Abuse: Patient with significant history of ETOH abuse\nwith evidence of end-organ damage, including pancreatitis and\nhepatitis. At the time of presentation, the patient was\nintoxicated with ETOH level of 366. Patient has had multiple\nhospitalizations related to ETOH abuse. The patient was started\non folate, thiamine, and a multivitamin on admission. She was\nmonitored on CIWA with PO diazepam, did not score on CIWA\n(likely because had only been drinking for max 6 days after 30\ndays of abstinence in rehab).  She was evaluated by social work\nand was recommended for an alcohol abuse partial day program to\nprevent relapse.  She will attend [**Hospital1 **] starting Wednesday,\n[**6-18**].  The patient was also resumed on home naltrexone\nprior to discharge.  She will follow up with her PCP on\ndischarge regarding her alcohol abuse.  Her behavioral health\ngroup coordinator was also notified of her admission and\ndischarge date to further plan support groups for the patient.\n\n.\n# Abdominal pain: Likely secondary to gastritis related to ETOH\nabuse.  LFTs mildly elevated, but consistent with her baseline\nas she has alcoholic hepatitis.  Lipase returned normal and\nabdominal exam remained clinically benign.  No evidence of bleed\nthroughout admission.  The patient was continued on omeprazole.\n.\n# Hypothermia: Pt hypothermic to 93 on admission, likely\nsecondary to wearing inadequate clothing in cold weather, poor\nnutritional state and receiving unwarmed IVF in ED. TSH was\nfound to be low (0.17), free T4 elevated.  The patient should\nfollow up with her PCP for repeat thyroid function studies.  She\nmay require thyroid suppression therapy.\n.\n# Depression/Anxiety: Followed as outpatient at [**Hospital1 778**] for dual\ndiagnosis, EtOH abuse and depression.  The patient's behavioral\nhealth coordinator was [**Hospital1 653**] regarding admission with\nplanned close follow-up.\n.\n# Bulimia/malnutrition: Patient reported it was not a current\nissue, but demonstrated binging and purging behavior with\nordering multiple meals and witnessed emesis in the MICU. The\npatient also has a poor nutritional status due to ETOH use.\nPatient was felt to be potentially at risk for refeeding. Her\nelectrolytes were monitored closely and repleted aggressively.\n=======================================\nTransitional Issues:\n- Patient scheduled an appointment with [**Hospital1 **] Outpatient\nServices in [**Location (un) 86**] on Wednesday, [**6-18**] at 10:30 AM. We have\nstrongly encouraged her to keep this appointment and call her\nPCP with any concerns.\n- The patient should undergo repeat check TSH/Free T4 on\ndischarge from the hospital, as she likely requires thyroid\nsuppression therapy\n\nMedications on Admission:\nPer recent d/c summary (not reconciled)\n1.
