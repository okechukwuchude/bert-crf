She was given NS\nand 1 unit FFP and Vitamin K 10mg IV x1 for elevated INR.\nFemoral line and peripheral placed, T&S obtained, started on\nProtonix Bolus/Gtt. Given an elevated WBC count, cough, CXR\nappearance and infected appearing U/A, the patient was started\non Vanc/Zosyn and admitted to the ICU.\n\nWith the assistance of a translator, the patient reports that\nshe is currently comfortable but for dry mouth. She has a cough\nbut is unsure of its duration and is unsure if she has had\nfevers. She recalls that she was nauseated and vomiting last\nnight and was nauseous earlier today but is without nausea or\nabdominal pain at this time. She denies any bleeding and bloody\nstools. She denies chest pain and reports that her breathing is\n\"bad as usual.\" Interview limited as she is hard of hearing and\nalso intermittently awake.

A calcified\nright\nfibrothorax, with calcified pleural densities and volume loss in\nthe right\nupper lobe, are similar in appearance. Bilateral pleural\neffusions with\nbibasilar opacities are new. A large hiatal hernia appears\nlarger.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Mild cardiomegaly.\n2. Calcified right fibrothorax, with new small bilateral pleural\neffusions\nwith associated atelectasis of the adjacent lower lobes.\n3. Large hiatal hernia.\n.\n[**1-4**] Echo:\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are\nnormal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly\ndilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve\nleaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not\npresent. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral\nvalve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve\nprolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]\ntricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\nIMPRESSION: Mildly dilated right ventricle with preserved global\nand regional biventircular systolic function. Mild aortic and\nmitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate\npulmonary hypertension.\n.\n[**1-4**] ECG:\nAtrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Diffuse\nST-T wave changes that are non-specific.

Hematemesis: The patient was admitted after 4-5 episodes of\ncoffee grounds emesis without hemodynamic instability, on\nAspirin, Plavix and Warfarin for a recent NSTEMI and ? PE during\na [**Month (only) 404**] admission to [**Hospital3 **].  Her INR was elevating\nto [**2-19**], likely due to a Ciprofloxacin interaction without a\nconcomittant dosage change.\nGI Consulted, no EGD necessary.  1 unit pRBCs transfused\nalthough the patient only experienced a drop in hematocrit\nconsistent with fluid hydration.  ASA restarted, Plavix and\nWarfarin held at time of transfer out of the ICU.  PPI converted\nfrom drip to bolus and the patient was able to advance her diet\nwithout issue. Based on risk/benefit ratio (CHADS = 1), are\nholding plavix and coumadin, but continuing aspirin on\ndischarge. Patient without stent or hardware, so also has\npresumed history of pulmonary embolism, no clear indication for\nplavix even in setting s/p NSTEMI. As such, given concern for\nbleed greater than benefit of antiplatelet, we have discontinued\nplavix. Opted to continue aspirin however. Hematocrit stable,\nafter initial drop, through rest of ICU stay as well as on the\nfloor.\n\n#. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Rate: The patient\nwas admitted with a sustained rate of 120s-130s in atrial\nfibrillation and a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.\nShe spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm with fluid and blood\nrescuscitation with a period of transient hypotension that\nresolved.  Her beta blocker was held while admitted to the MICU.\n.\nSeveral days into her course patient spontaneously converted\nback into atrial fibrillation with rapid rate, accompanied by\nworsening dyspnea and pulmonary edema.  Rate was controlled with\nIV metoprolol which was later converted to PO metoprolol, which\nwas later uptitrated for better rate control.  Rate was well\ncontrolled on this regimen.\n.\nGiven CHADS 1 and recent GI bleed (as well as h/o recurrent\nfalls), the decision was made not to anticoagulate, coumadin is\ndiscontinued.\n\n# Pulmonary edema: In the setting of afib with RVR, patient\ndeveloepd pulmonary edema. She was diuresed gently with 10 mg IV\nlasix boluses and was approximately 2 L net negative over the\nnext 24 hours with improvement in dyspnea and oxygenation. If\nshe becomes SOB again, we strongly recommend considering fluid\noverload with potential treatment with low-dose lasix (as well\nas consideration of aspiration).\n\n#. Leukocytosis with bacteruria: The patient had a rapidly\nrising WBC with Left shift but no bands, positive U/A (recent\nEnterobacter infection) and ? PNA on CXR.  She received\nVanc/Zosyn in the ED presumably for a PNA but was converted to\nVanc/Cefepime/Cipro then Vanc/Cefepime. No clear source\nidentified initially.  Given persistence of WBC prior to leaving\nthe ICU, repeat cultures were sent, and CXR showed worsening\ninfiltrates. To continue to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia\n(including pseudomonas), she was continued on cefepime only -\nplanning for 8 day course, so 2 days more of once daily\nantibiotics (cefepime) at rehab.\n\n#. Hypoxia/COPD: The patient has an O2 requirement that was\ninitially likely secondary to COPD and/or pneumonia (see above).\n Nebulizers were continued. On room air at discharge.\n.\n#. CAD/Recent NSTEMI: Patient was on ASA, Plavix and metoprolol\nafter recent NSTEMI, no percutaneous intervention or hardware\npresent. Troponin elevated here, but with normal CK/CK-MB, and\nthe troponin remained flat. With impaired GFR and recent NSTEMI\nthis may represent old MI, renal failure or MI within the last 7\ndays. EKG was not revealing of ST changes. Decided to\ndiscontinue plavix in setting of GI bleed and risk > benefit.\nDid restart 162mg enteric-coated ASA.\n\n#. Dysphagia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event. Evaluated\nby speech & swallow. Placed on dysphagia diet. Concern for\naspiration continues.\n.\n#. ? PE: The patient has an uncertain history of PE based on\nelevated PA pressure from [**Hospital3 5097**], no confirmatory test\nperformed per HebReb records and daughter.  [**Name (NI) 227**] uncertainty\n(and CHADS = 1) and her current high bleeding risk, we\ndiscontinued coumadin and let her INR drift down.\n\n#.

This\nresolved on its own, without any procedure other than medical\nmanagement. Gastreoenterology was consulted and monitored your\ncourse. Your blood level (hematocrit) remained stable after the\ninitial admission decrease.\n.\nYou had an irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation) that became\nrapid (rapid ventricular response) on 2 occasions, and responded\nto fluid resuscitation as well as diuresis. After that, with\nmedication, your heart rate control has improved.\n.\nYou had some fluid on your lungs, and diuresis with low-dose\nlasix improved your respiratory status. If you have more\nshortness of breath, consideration to give another one-time low\nlasix would be important.\n.\nYou were on medications for a presumed pulmonary embolism\n(plavix and aspirin) but we feel that given you had a bleed,\nyour risk of bleed outweighs the benefits, and so we are\ndischarging you solely on aspirin, and not on plavix anymore.\n.\nYou were on coumadin for atrial fibrillation and for a presumed\npulmonary embolism, but given your history of falls and your\ngastrointestinal bleed on this admission, it is felt that the\nrisk of bleed outweighs the benefit of stroke prevention, and so\nwe have discontinued your coumadin.\n.\nYou were found to be aspirating, so your diet was changed per\nspeech & swallow recommendations.\n.\nYou had evidence of a pneumonia, so you are being empirically\ntreated, and you have 2 more days of IV antibiotics to finish\nyour course.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nPlease see your primary care physician after you leave from\n[**Hospital 100**] Rehab.\n\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2125-1-9**]"
