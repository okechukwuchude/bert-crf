She was aggressively volume\nresuscitated with 5 L of crystalloid and transfused 2 units of\nPRBCs after continuning to pass dilute blood with a Golytely\nprep, which was then held the first night of the hospitalization\nafter completing half of the prep. On hospital day 2, she\nunderwent colonoscopy, which was remarkable for bleeding in the\ncecum, the site of 2 of her polypectomies 9 days prior to\nadmission; 4 clips were placed with adequate hemostasis. Her\nvolume and hematocrit subsequently remained stable. She was\ndischarged home in stable condition.\n\n# Tender hepatomegaly: The patient's liver was slightly tender\nto palpation on admission, which prompted and abdominal\nultrasound, which subsequently showed that the liver was normal.\n\n# Pancreatic cyst on US: On abdominal ultrasound a pancreatic\ncyst was found incidentally described as a 1.3 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm\npredominantly hypoechoic lesion in the pancreatic head/neck; it\nis likely benign. This will be further evaluated on an\noutpatient basis after discharge with an MRCP.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n- Simvastatin 60mg PO HS\n- HCTZ 12.5mg PO HS\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. Simvastatin 20 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO at bedtime.\nTablet(s)\n2. STOPPED: Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg Capsule Sig: One (1)\nCapsule PO once a day: Take in mornings; Restart in a week\n\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nHome\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nLower GI bleed from cecal polypectomy site\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nIt was a privilege to take care of you in the hospital.\n.\nYou were hospitalized for a bleed in your colon caused by the\nre-bleeding of one of your polypectomy sites in your cecum. You\nwere admitted to the ICU with a low blood count and low blood\npressures when sitting up and standing. We resuscitated your\nvolume and blood coutns with IV fluids and 2 units of packed red\nblood cells. A CT of yoru abdomen did not show the bleeding\nsource, but a colonoscopy revealed the source, which was stopped\nwith clips. You also underwent an abdominal ultrasound because\nyour liver was slightly tender on admission, which showed a\nnormal liver but an incidental finding of a pancreatic cyst. We\nrecommend that you have this finding evaluated further as an\noutpatient.\n.\nNo changes were made to your home medications.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nPlease schedule an appointment with Gastroenterology for\nevaluation of your pancreas\n\n\n\n"
