Said in the last week, he has used his nitro\n4-5x/day.  Up until one month ago, he \"never\" used his nitro.\nReports some additional anxiety since he got the stress test\nresults back and thinks that is contributing to his increased\nuse of nitro.  Denies having any chest pressure, just this\nsensation which is described as follows: starts with a tightened\nsensation in his throat that progresses down to his heart.  Does\nnot occur at rest.  Denies any radiation of pain, jaw\nclaudication, syncope, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or\npalpitations.  Says this is the same sensation he had while in\nthe cath lab today and when he got to the CCU.  At this time, he\nis not having any chest pain.\n.\nAdmitted to CCU with plans to undergo CABG on [**8-1**].\n.\nOn review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,\nTIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the\ntime of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black\nstools or red stools. Hhe denies recent fevers, chills or\nrigors.  He reports denies exertional buttock and calf pain.

The patient appears\nto be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the\nMD caring for the patient.\nConclusions\nPRE BYPASS No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in\nthe body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial\nseptal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular\nwall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is\nmoderately dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular\nsystolic dysfunction with mid-distal anterior, anteroseptal and\napical severe hypokinesis/akinesis. No apical thrombus is seen.\nOverall left ventricular systolic function is moderately\ndepressed (LVEF= 30-35%%). The right ventricle displays\nborderline normal free wall function. There are simple atheroma\nin the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending\nthoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly\nthickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic\nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no\npericardial effusion. An intra-aortic balloon (IAB) is seen with\nits tip at the level of the distal aortic arch/proximal\ndescending aortic transition area. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in\nperson of the results in the operating room at the time of the\nstudy.\n\nPOST BYPASS The patient is receiving epinephrine by infusion.\nThere is normal right ventricular systolic function. The focal\nabnormalities of the apical, anterior, and anteropseptal walls\nnoted in the pre-bypass study are improved and now display mild\nhypokinesis. The left ventricular systolic function is now in\nthe 40 to 45% range. Valvular function is unchanged. The\nthoracic aorta appears intact. The IAB remains as noted in the\npre-bypass study.\n  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance\nwith HCFA regulations.\n\nElectronically signed by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4901**], MD, Interpreting physician\n[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2124-8-1**] 13:39\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nAngina- Patient experienced angina while undergoing cath\nprocedure on [**7-31**].  Cath showed 3VD.  Intra-aortic balloon\nplaced to improved coronary flow.  Upon admission to floor,\nnitro gtt was restarted.  Heparin IV as well as IABP heparin\nprotocol started.  He had residual pain that resolved upon\nresuming nitro gtt.  EKG initially showed isolated STE in V2\nwith T-wave inversion in avL and V3.  Enzymes trended.  Denied\nany chest pain overnight.

Mr. [**Known lastname 2816**] was\nextubated on POD#1 and epi and levo were weaned off. Chest tubes\nwere removed and Mr. [**Known lastname 2816**] was transferred to the floor on\nPOD#2.
