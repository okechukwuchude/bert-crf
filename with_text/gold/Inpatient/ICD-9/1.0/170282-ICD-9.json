PE unlikely without chest pain.  Severity of desats\n   difficult to measure - low 90s on sat monitoring but had ABG with paO2\n   >200.\n   - Monitor sats/respiratory efforts; may need stimulation overnight to\n   overcome effects of narcotics at first.  Trying to avoid narcan\n   administration.\n   - Will continue on [**First Name3 (LF) **] as tolerated to eliminate obstructive\n   component.\n   - Consider diuresis given likely some effect of pulmonary edema in\n   hypoxia.\n   - Care with naproxen given volume status, consider dc if end up needing\n   to diurese.\n   - Consider carboxyhemoglobin/methemoglobin given discrepancies between\n   sats and paO2.\n   - Trial of nebs when off CPAP.\n   - Needs sleep followup as outpatient and/or inpatient.\n   .\n   # s/p TKR.\n   - Lovenox for prophylaxis.\n   - Cephalosporins as written post op.\n   - hold PCA for now, can try PO oxycodone if needed but want patient to\n   wake up more before giving.\n   .\n   # Diabetes.\n   - Insulin sliding scale.\n   .\n   # Hypertension.\n   - continue home valsartan, HCTZ.\n   .\n   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, sips and advance as tolerated\n   Prophylaxis: lovenox, H2B\n   Access: peripherals\n   Code:  Full\n   Communication: Patient\n   Disposition: pending clinical improvement\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition: sips, advance as tolerate\n   Glycemic Control: insulin sliding scale\n   Lines:\n   20 Gauge - [**2101-3-28**] 10:49 PM\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT: lovenox\n   Stress ulcer: H2B\n   VAP:\n   Comments:\n   Communication:  Comments:\n   Code status: full\n   Disposition: ICU for tonight\n"
