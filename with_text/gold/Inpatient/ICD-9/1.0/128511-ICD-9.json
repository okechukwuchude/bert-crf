The patient reports\nthat she has been having watery diarrhea, gas and mild abd pain\nfor several weeks - stopped taking lasix [**1-2**] diarrhea. She\nrecently saw her PCP who had placed her on two antibiotics. Her\ndiarrhea began to resolve. However, she then underwent a abd CT\nscan with barium on [**2157-11-21**] and then began having diarrhea\nsince then. She saw her PCP again on [**2157-11-29**] and was doing\nwell. On her return home, she began to feel very weak. Her\ndaughter, a nurse, noted that she was unstable, confused and had\nher BIBA to an OSH ED. There she  had a repeat CT scan and RUQ\nshowing common bile duct stones. In addition, she had a fever to\n105, abdominal pain and vomiting x 2 and was given Unasyn and\nLevofloxacin. She was then transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for ERCP.\n\nIn the ED, the patient was febrile to 103. RUQ U/S confirmed\ncholedocolithiasis. GI contact[**Name (NI) **] - ERCP when IR less than 1.5.\nShe was given tylenol and one liter IVF. On exam in the ED, she\nwas well appearing, mildly diffusely tender in her abd,\ninitially tachycardic to 155. She also had one large watery foul\nsmelling stool. Vitals: temp 100.1 Hr 95, Bp 110/50 19 97% 2L.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nDiverticulitis- s/p colectomy and reanastamosis may years ago\n?

No focal\nhepatic\nlesion is identified. The intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts\nare dilated.\nThe common duct at the head of the pancreas measures 1 cm.\nMultiple shadowing echogenic foci are identified within the\ncommon bile duct consistent with stones. The gallbladder\ncontains multiple stones. There is no evidence of cholecystitis.\nThe visualized pancreas is normal. The right kidney measures\n10.4 cm and shows mild dilatation of the collecting system and\nureter\n\nERCP:\nEsophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal\nStomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal\nDuodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal\nMajor Papilla: Normal major papilla\n\nCannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and\ndeep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast\nmedium was injected resulting in complete opacification.\n\nBiliary Tree: Three stones ranging in size from 3mm to 6mm that\nwere causing partial obstruction were seen at the lower third of\nthe common bile duct and middle third of the common bile duct.\nOtherwise the bile duct was normal. No pus was noted.\n\nProcedures: A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock\nposition using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. 3\nstones were extracted successfully using a balloon. Occlusion\ncholangiogram did not show any filling defects.\n\nImpression: Stones in the bile duct, otherwise normal biliary\ntree. No pus was seen. A biliary sphincterotomy was performed.\nStones were extracted using a balloon. (sphincterotomy, stone\nextraction)\n\nRecommendations: Absence of pus and normal LFTs do not eliminate\ncholangitis as the cause of patients high fevers, but make it\nless likely. Consider evaluation for colits given diarrhea and\nthickening in the sigmoid colon on CT scan.\n\n[**2157-12-3**] CT abd/pelvis with contrast:\nSTUDY: CT of the abdomen and pelvis.\n\nHISTORY: 86-year-old female with recurrent diarrhea, fevers and\nquestion of\ncolon mass seen at outside hospital.\n\nCOMPARISONS: None.\n\nTECHNIQUE: Following the administration of intravenous contrast,\nMDCT axial\nimages were acquired from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis.\nCoronal and\nsagittal reformatted images were then obtained.\n\nCT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Tiny bilateral pleural\neffusions with\nassociated atelectasis are present at the lung bases. Left-sided\npneumobilia\nwhich may relate to the patient's recent ERCP two days prior is\nevident.\nMinimal intrahepatic biliary dilatation is present. The liver is\notherwise\nunremarkable without focal lesion. Layering gallstones are\nevident. However,\nthe gallbladder is not distended and no wall edema or\npericholecystic fluid is\nseen. The pancreatic duct is prominent at the level of the\npancreatic head\nmeasuring 4 mm in diameter (2:26). The pancreatic duct at the\nlevel of the\nbody and tail is normal in caliber. Mild stranding at the level\nof the amuplla\nis compatibel with recent ERCP. The spleen and adrenal glands\nare\nunremarkable. Several low- attenuation foci within the left\nkidney are too\nsmall to characterize but likely represent simple cysts. The\nstomach and small\nbowel are unremarkable. There is no free air within the abdomen.\nThe abdominal\nportion of the colon is unremarkable.\n\nCT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A few diverticula of the\nsigmoid colon are\npresent. The wall of the sigmoid colon along the majority of its\nentire\ncourse is irregular and oral contrast material does not pass\ndistal to the\nlower aspect. Several foci of probable extraluminal air are\nnoted along the\nantimesenteric border (2:58). These may represent outpouchings\nof the wall\nand diverticula or contained perforation. A long segment of\nsigmoid colonic\nwall irregularity, extending to the rectosigmoid junction, spans\na distance of\napproximately 7 mm and mild surrounding inflammatory change is\nalso evident.\nThe bladder is unremarkable, although it contains a moderate\namount of air. No\nFoley catheter is seen. Intrapelvic loops of small bowel are\nunremarkable. No\nadnexal masses. No pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic\nlymph nodes are\npresent.\n\nOSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative change at the L2-3 level with\nassociated\nendplate sclerosis. No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Long segment of lower sigmoid colonic wall irregularity and\npossible\nassociated contained foci of extraluminal air. A few sigmoid\ncolonic\ndiverticula are noted. The differential diagnosis includes long\nsegment\ndiverticulitis with contained perforation, but given the\nirregular appearance of the wall of the lower sigmoid colon in\nparticular, carcinoma must also be considered and direct\nvisualization via endoscopy is advised.\n2. Pneumobilia likely related to recent ERCP. Minimal\nintrahepatic biliary\ndilatation.\n3. Mild pancreatic ductal dilatation at the level of the\npancreatic head may be related to recent ERCP procedure.\n4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.\n\n[**2157-12-1**] ERCP:\nFindings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal\nStomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal\nDuodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal\nMajor Papilla: Normal major papilla\nCannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and\ndeep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast\nmedium was injected resulting in complete opacification.\n\nBiliary Tree: Three stones ranging in size from 3mm to 6mm that\nwere causing partial obstruction were seen at the lower third of\nthe common bile duct and middle third of the common bile duct.\nOtherwise the bile duct was normal. No pus was noted.\nProcedures: A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock\nposition using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.\n3 stones were extracted successfully using a balloon. Occlusion\ncholangiogram did not show any filling defects.\n\nImpression: Stones in the bile duct, otherwise normal biliary\ntree. No pus was seen.\nA biliary sphincterotomy was performed.\nStones were extracted using a balloon.\n(sphincterotomy, stone extraction)\n\nRecommendations: Return to ICU.\nAbsence of pus and normal LFTs do not eliminate cholangitis as\nthe cause of patients high fevers, but make it less likely.\nConsider evaluation for colits given diarrhea and thickening in\nthe sigmoid colon on CT scan.\n\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMICU COURSE:\n86year-old female with a history of mild CHF, diverticulitis who\nwas transfered from OSH with cholangitis/choledocolithiasis for\nERCP.  At the OSH she was febrile to 105 and CT scan there\nshowed biliary dilation.  She was started on cipro/flagyl on\nadmission to [**Hospital1 18**]. Here, her RUQ ultrasound also showed biliary\ndilation. She underwent ERCP on [**2157-12-1**] which showed several\nlarge steons which were removed by no frank pus or other\nevidence of cholangitis.  Of note, she also reported having 4\nweeks of intermittent watery diarrhea which is improving. She is\ncurrently free of abdominal pain at rest, has minimal pain with\npalpation.\n\n1. Leukocytosis, fever, Diverticulitis: with LLQ pain and\ncopious/watery diarrhea most concerning for\ncolitis/diverticulitis.  OSH CT consistent with colitis, but\nalso demonstrates choledocholithiasis.  Underwent ERCP (see\nbelow) and large stone removed, but no pus.  LFTs wnl, not\nconsistent with biliary obstruction. Initially treated with\nlevofloxacin and flagyl for presumed LLQ source.  CT abd/pelvis\nwith contrast performed at [**Hospital1 18**] revealed a long segment of\nlower sigmoid colonic wall irregularity and possible associated\ncontained foci of extraluminal air and a few sigmoid colonic\ndiverticula are noted. The differential diagnosis includes long\nsegment diverticulitis with contained perforation, but given the\nirregular appearance of the wall of the lower sigmoid colon in\nparticular, carcinoma must also be considered and direct\nvisualization via endoscopy is advised.\nThe surgical service was consulted regarding the CT findings and\nthe patient's recurrent diverticulitis and the plan was made for\noutpatient surgical evaluation.  The patient was discharged on a\nprolonged course of cipro/flagyl to continue for another 14 days\nafter discharge (for a total of almost 21 days) given the CT\nfindings of diverticulitis with contained perforation.\n-Patient to f/u closely with surgery and PCP as outpatient.\n-Patient needs outaptient colonoscopy when diverticulitis flare\nhas resolved.\n\n2. Choledocholithiasis: ERCP on [**2157-12-1**]--sphincterotomy performed\nand 3 stones removed.  With abscence of pus or LFT\nabnormalities, ascending cholangitis thought to be less likely\nsource of high fever and leukocytosis. General surgery consult\nfor consideration of cholecystectomy was placed.  Given the\npatient's ventral hernia and prior abdominal surgery, the plan\nwas for an outpatient elective open cholecystectomy.\n-Outpatient open cholecystectomy.\n\n3. Diarrhea: large volume and watery for weeks prior to\nadmission. Had improvement with an initial course of\nantibiotics. Stool studies pending. CT also demonstrates\nfecal-loaded colon--but given ongoing diarrhea, bowel regimen\nnot started.  Treated with levofloxacin and flagyl.\n\n4.  Elevated INR: 1.8 on admission, 1.6 day after admission.\nPatient not on anticoagulation. Likely related to protein loss\nwith the diarrhea. Also has low albumin.  FFP given prior to\nERCP.\n\n5. Code Status: Full code.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nDigoxin 0.25mg every other day\nDigoxin 0.125mg every other day\nprotonix\nlasix - stopped recently for diarrhea\nAlendronate\nrecently started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl on [**2157-11-30**]\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
