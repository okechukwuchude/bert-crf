No fracture, hemorrhage, or edema.\n2. Chronic small vessel ischemic disease and age-related\nparenchymal\ninvolutional change.\n3. Right parietal scalp hematoma.\n\nECHO [**12-8**]:\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left\nventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global\nsystolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical\nquality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully\nexcluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left\nventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is mild\naortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic\nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary\nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-7-9**], the\naortic valve gradient has increased.\n\nCXR [**12-10**]: Standard position of the pacemakers with no evidence\nof\ncomplications.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **] y/o woman admitted to hospital s/p fall and transfered to the\nCCU with bradycardia\n\n# Bradycardia: Pt was initially admitted to the wards, where\ntelemetry demonstrated marked sinus pauses with an irregular\nrate of approx 20.  During these episodes she was witnessed to\nbe hypotensive and have myoclonic jerking and a blue tinge to\nher lips. She was then transferred to the CCU, where she had\nsimilar episodes responsive to atropine, including an epsiode of\nsevere bradycardia with loss of consciousness, brief respiratory\narrest with stable O2 sat, awoke shaking after atropine.\nEtiology was thought to be is sick sinus or sinus exit block as\nno unconducted p waves observed during bradycardia. Family\nagreed to PPM placement and reversal of DNR/DNI status for\nprocedure.  Pacemaker was placed without complications on [**12-9**],\nafter which pt's code status was reversed back to DNR/DNI and\nshe had no furthur arrhythmic episodes. Pacemaker was\ninterigated and chest imaged and pt given 3 day course of\nKeflex. She is to follow up with electrophysiology in 1 wk.\n\n# Hypovolemia: Pt appeared dry on presenation and had decreased\nurine output which responded well to IVF. The orthostasis may\nhave contributed to falls.\n\n# Elevated TSH: TFTs were checked and since T3 and T4 were\nnormal, etiology was thought to be sick euthyroid.\n\n# Fall: Likely etiology was multifactorial - sinus\npauses/bradycardia and orthostasis. Mild AS on echo unlikely to\nbe suffient to be responsible. There were no focal neuro\ndeficits and pt was evaluated by physical therapy, who\ndetermined that pt would require rehab for strengthening.\n\n# Hypertension: Pt's home metoprolol was initially held, and\nrestarted after PPM was placed and blood pressures raised.\n\n# Depression: Pt was continued on fluoxetine\n\n# Hyperlipidemia: Statin continued\n\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nasa 81 mg daily\nCa w/ Vit D 600 mg [**Hospital1 **]\ndocusate 100mg [**Hospital1 **]\nfluoxetine 20 mg daily\nmetoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]\nsimvastatin 10 mg qhs\nvit B-12 100 mg daily\nsenna prn\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
