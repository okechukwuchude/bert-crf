A\npreliminary head CT showed no acute intracranial abnormality\nwith chronic findings (old R parietal craniotomy, old R burr\nhole).  Labs were notable for lactate 1.2, normal chem 7, normal\nCBC, normal UA, ammonia 32 (WNL). Tox negative for ethanol,\nsalicylates, acetominophen.  The patient was intubated for\nfailure to oxygenate/ventilate and inability to protect airway\n(sedation and confusion).

Initially in the ED, she was \"fighting\nthe vent\" and was making purposeful movements of all 4\nextremities to attempt to remove the ETT, she was then heavily\nsedated in the ED with fentanyl and midazolam.  She received\n500mg azithromycin and 1g of ceftriaxone.  Neurology was\nconsulted who recommended EEG.\n\nOn arrival to the MICU, patient's VS.  94.5, 73, 97/64. Patient\nwas intubated and sedated.

ET tube is at the carina and should be repositioned.\nBilateral low lung volumes are noted with crowding of\nbronchovascular markings.  Cardiac silhouette is accentuated by\nlow lung volumes.  Additionally, opacification at the left lung\nbase and in the retrocardiac region appears concerning for\neither pleural effusion versus atelectasis, infectious process\nsuch as pneumonia cannot be completely excluded in the correct\nclinical setting.\n\nCXR 8.21\nIn comparison with the study of [**7-29**], there again are lower lung\n\nvolumes.  Cardiac silhouette is within upper limits of normal or\nslightly\nenlarged.  Minimal poor definition of pulmonary vessels could\nreflect slight\nelevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Blunting of\ncostophrenic angles could\nreflect small effusions or pleural thickening.\n\nNo definite pneumonia is appreciated, though in the appropriate\nclinical\nsetting a supervening consolidation would be difficult to\nexclude in lower\nzones.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n63 yo F with PMH alcohol abuse with seizures, SDH s/p burr hole\n5 years ago admitted with acute change in mental status.\n\n# Acute Respiratory Failure:  Patient arrived to the ICU\nintubated for respiratory failure in settting of acute\nconfusional state.  The patient's initial ABG was reassuring and\nshe was deemed able to extubate.  She was extubated on the day\nof arrival to the ICU and tolerated it well.  Her oxygen\nsaturation remained in the mid to high 90s on room air.  The\netiology of her respiratory was felt to be her toxic-metabolic\nencephalopathy as noted below.\n\n# Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy:  The patient presented with\nacute altered mental status with history of alcohol abuse and\nseizures, also with history of SDH s/p craniotomy 5 years ago.\nThe etiology was unclear, but the differential included alcohol\nwithdrawal/seizure, toxic metabolic (hepatic encephalopathy),\nCVA/ICH, sepsis, wernicke's encephalopathy.  UA unremarkable.\nAmmonia level normal.  Lactic acid WNL.  Drug induced possible,\nhome medications were difficult to clarify (the patient and her\nfamily were poor historians).  The patient showed no signs of\nalcohol withdrawl and required only one dose of diazepam on the\nCIWA protocol, which was mostly given for insomnia.  She was\ngiven thiamine.  Neurology was consulted and they performed an\nEEG, which showed no epileptiform activity.  The day of\ndischarge, she developed a headache, but a repeat head CT was\nnormal, and she felt better after Tylenol and ibuprofen so was\ndischarged to follow-up as an outpatient.\n\n# Chronic cough: the pt had a non-productive cough during your\nadmission, which has been present for several years, according\nto the patient.  She had no fevers, chills, oxygen requirement\nor leukocytosis, so she was not treated for a pneumonia, and she\nfelt this was at her baseline.  I suspect she may have COPD due\nto second hand smoke exposure (ex-husband smoked for 25 years\nwith her).  She should have outpatient PFTs done to further\nevaluate this.\n\n# Coordination of care: I attempted to speak with the patient's\nPCP and Neurologist, but neither were available by phone on the\nday of discharge.  They will be sent a copy of this summary.\n\n# Inactive issues: The patient was continued on her home\namitriptyline, fluoxetine, furosemide, gabapentin, topiramate,\nand methocarbamol.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nPreadmission medications listed are correct and complete.\nInformation was obtained from Family/CaregiverPharmacy.\n1. risedronate *NF* 35 mg Oral WEEKLY\n2.

You\nbecame progressively more confused until you were taken to\n[**Hospital1 18**]-[**Hospital1 **] where your evaluation included a head CT, which was\nunchanged from your prior (not normal due to your history of\nsubdural hemorrhage ~5 yrs ago with old R parietal craniotomy,\nold R burr hole). Lab testing was unremarkable.  You were\nintubated (placed on a breathing machine) because your mental\nstatus was so poor and you could not protect your airway and you\nwere transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 86**]. Here you were quickly\nextubated (taken off the breathing machine) and you\nspontaneously improved. The Neurology consult team saw you and\ncould not explain what had happened.  You developed a headache\non the day of discharge, but a repeat head CT was normal, and\nyou felt better after Tylenol and ibuprofen so were discharged\nto follow-up as an outpatient.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nPrimary Care\nPlease follow-up with your primary care doctor within the next\nfew weeks.  Dr. [**Last Name (un) **] (your [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 86**] discharging\nphysician) called Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1437**], but he was unavailable.  After\nreviewing your discharge summary, his office will call you with\nan appointment.  Please be sure to discuss your medications and\npossible pulmonary function testing at this appointment.\n\nNeurology\nPlease follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as you had previously planned.\n\n\n                             [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Last Name (un) **] MD [**MD Number(2) 11224**]\n\nCompleted by:[**2109-7-31**]"
