P MIBI showed PDA\nand mild LAD reversible ischemia.  Had intermittant chest pain\ntreated with IV morphine. ECG's unchanged. Caridac\ncatheterization performed with no significant CAD found. Right\ngroin angioseal done. Pt states his chest pain is now gone and\nhe feels that it is from the ibuprofen. LIkely pt has some\ngastritis from the ibuprofen although the severity and radiation\nof the pain does not suggest mild gastritis.
