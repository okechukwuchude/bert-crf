Patient does not remember any other details at this time.\n   There were no witnesses, and it is not clear how long she was down\n   for.  She was initially admitted to the MICU for ARF, troponin leak and\n   nonspecific EKG changes.\n   .\n   See MICU admission note for complete admission details.  Of note, the\n   patient did have intermittent desats while in the MICU, associated\n   mostly with transfusions or fluid.  CXR did not show infiltrates and no\n   treatment for infection was initiated.  She was diuresed as needed and\n   tolerated it well with only nasal canula supplemental oxygen.  She\n   received 3 u PRBCs pre-op for anemia (guiac negative) and responded\n   appropriately.  Goal hct was 30 due to her troponin leak.\n   .\n   She was transferred to the floor where she did well.  She was on 4L\n   nasal canula at the time.  Today, she had an ORIF of her R hip.\n   Intraoperatively, they had a difficult time assessing her O2 sat due to\n   poor pleth.  She has also hypotensive and on neo for a short time.\n   Post op, they continued to have a difficult time getting a pleth and an\n   ABG was obtained showing 7.34/43/36.  She was lethargic.  She was\n   started on bipap and her next gas was 7.39/74.  She had received 2 mg\n   IV morphine, __ fentanyl, and then 6 mg IV morphine post-op.  She was\n   moaning to movement and would follow commands, moving all extremities\n   and squeezing.\n   .\n   On arrival to the ICU, she is more alert, has no complaints of pain and\n   is tolerating the bipap mask well.\n   .\n   Review of systems:\n   (+) Per HPI\n   (-) (per floor team) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight\n   loss or gain.

No other fractures are identified. Mild degenerative\nchanges\ninvolving the SI joints and lumbar spine are noted. There is a\nnormal bowel\ngas pattern.\nIMPRESSION: Right subcapital hip fracture as described above.\n.\nCT ABD/PELVIS [**2128-2-13**]\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Right subcapital hip fracture.\n2. Fibroid uterus.\n3. Distended bladder with mild left pelvic fullness.\n4. Bilateral adrenal gland thickening, left greater than right.\n.\nCT HEAD [**2128-2-13**]\nIMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.\n.\nCT C-SPINE [**2128-2-13**]\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No evidence of acute fracture.\n2. Multilevel degenerative changes as described above.\n3. Lung apices suggestive of edema, inflammatory, or small\nairways disease, vs infectious process.\n4. 6mm peripherally calcified right thyroid nodule for which\nfurther\nevaluation with ultrasound.\n.\nEKG [**2128-2-13**]\nSinus rhythm. The P-R interval is prolonged. There is a late\ntransition with Q waves and ST-T wave changes in the anterior\nleads consistent with probable prior anterior myocardial\ninfarction. There are tiny R waves in the inferior leads\nconsistent with possible prior inferior myocardial infarction.\nCompared to the previous tracing ST segment changes are new.\n.\nCXR [**2128-2-13**]\nIMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.\n.\nR HIP FILMS [**2128-2-16**]\nFINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-13**], views from the\noperating suite show placement of three metallic screws across\nthe previously described fracture of the femur.\n.\n[**2128-2-16**] ECHO:\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is unusually\nsmall. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion\nabnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular\nsystolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular\ncavity is markedly dilated with severe global free wall\nhypokinesis. There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position\nconsistent with right ventricular volume overload. The diameters\nof aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic\nstenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mitral\nregurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery\nsystolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic\npericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Markedly dilated right ventricle with severe global\nhypokinesis. At least moderate pulmonary hypertension. Small\nleft ventricular cavity size with preserved systolic function.\n.\n[**2038-2-16**] CAROTID ULTRASOUNDS\nIMPRESSION: There is less than 40% stenosis within the internal\ncarotid\narteries bilaterally.\n.\n[**2128-2-17**] CXR\nFINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-16**], there has been a\nsubstantial decrease in the bilateral opacification, which had\nbeen more prominent on the left and could have represented\neither asymmetric pulmonary edema or diffuse aspiration. Some\nresidual areas of opacification are seen at the right base\nlaterally and at the left base. These most likely represent\nresidual aspiration or possible atelectasis.\n.\n[**2128-2-18**] EKG\nNormal sinus rhythm with Q waves in the right precordial leads\nconsistent with anterior wall myocardial infarction. Q waves in\nthe inferior leads consistent with inferior myocardial\ninfarction. Compared to tracing #2 there is no change.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n73F PMHx of DM, seizure disorder and breast cancer, found down\non her floor with R hip fx s/p fall, admitted to the ICU with\nhip fx, ARF, NSTEMI, and hypoxia. Hospital course by problem:\n\n# Elevated Cardiac Enzymes and EKG Changes: Had elevated\ntroponins in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **] and new TWI both in the setting\nof anemia. [**Hospital **] medical regimen included ASA 81mg, statin\n80mg daily, and beta blocker. ACE-I was held given recent acute\non chronic renal failure and preserved EF as seen on echo (see\nbelow).\n.\n# Right Hip Fracture s/p Fall.  Pt was evaluated by orthopedics\nwho planned for\nminimally invasive pinning procedure pending medical clearance,\nwhich was provided by daughter, [**Name (NI) 1785**], as pt was delirious.\nWent to OR on [**2128-2-16**], no complications intra-op, but did go back\not the ICU for overnight monitoring as she had some hypoxia\npostoperatively (had received a larga amount of morphine). She\ncommenced PT POD#1, and was significantly limited by pain, but\nthis improved by POD#3 (ay of d/c). She did receive narcotics\naround the time of PT to aid in progress.  Pain was also managed\nwith tylenol. She was discharged on lovenox 40mg sQ daily for\nDVT ppx, and with orthopedic followup.\n\n# Pancyopenia: Presented with acute on chronic anemia with\nbaseline in low 30s, as well as thrombocytopenia with nadir\nplatelets in the 40s, and leukopenia to a nadir of 2.1 Felt\nlikely [**1-13**] methotrexate use with questionable use of folate\n(marrow suppressive process).  She was transfused 3 units in the\nICU and on HD#2 had a stable Hct to 32.8.  DDAVP was given for\nlow platelets. Her methotrexate was held, she received\nsupplemental folic acid, and all cell lines recovered to normal\nby discharge. She will followup with erh rheumatologist for ?\nresumption of methotrexate.\n\n# Acute Kidney Injury: Baseline creatinine = 1.3, but she\npresented with creatinine 1.8 -> max of 2.2 in setting of fall.\nNormal CKs made rhabdo unlikely. Felt likely [**1-13**] hypoperfusion\nand prerenal state.  Pt. was given IVF boluses and Cr decreased\nto 1.3 by discharge.\n\n# Transaminitis: Had elevations of ALT, AST and Alk Phos without\nelevation in bilis. Unclear etiology, felt [**1-13**] mild ischemic\nliver in setting of hypotension. Her methotrexate was also held.\nLFTs had entirely normalized by discharge.\n\n# IDDM: well-controlled by A1c.  FS were checked every 4 hours\nand she was placed on an insuling sliding scale.  Her lisinopril\nwas held. On discharge,her metformin was continued, but\nlisinopril was still held in setting of recent acute renal\nfailure.\n\n# Fall: unclear etiology in pt with h/o seizure d/o and multiple\nCAD risk factors.\nHer cardiac enzymes were followed and Trop was trended from\n0.16-->0.22-->0.22, so an MI could be the etiology but this\ncould also have been a conseqeunce of her fall. Further syncope\nworkup included monitoring on telemetry without significant\narryhtmia, sending a tegretol level (normal), repeating EKGs\n(developed signs of MI), and carotid ultrasounds which were\nnormal. Head CT and Cspine Ct in ED were negative.\n\n# Hypoxia - pt still had minimal O2 requirement on d/c. Has\nknown OSA per prior sleep evaluations. Also received many liters\nof IVF and 3 units of blood during her hospital course, so ?\nsome element of hypervolemia, but phsical exam did not support\nthis. Echo performed this admission revealed preserved EF of\n60-65% but markedly dilated RV with severe global free wall\nhypokinesis. There was abnormal diastolic septal motion/position\nconsistent with right ventricular volume overload. There was\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. This was\nthought to possible represent sequelae from her MI. Pulmonary\nembolism was on the differential but given her acute on chronic\nrenal failure, a CT-A was deferred, and the patient was allowed\nto autodiurese and recover from the imediate postoperative\nperiod and wean off of narcotics. If persistent, this could be\nfurther worked up as an outpatient.\n\n# RA:  methotrexate was held during admission given pancytopenia\nabove.\n\n# Depression: dx with mild depression - Effexor therapy was\ncontinued\n\n# Dementia/Delerium: unclear circumstances of diagnosis, per\nrecord patient reporting forgetfulness, psych testing showing\nmild attention deficits.  She was continued on Aricept. She did\nexperience significant delirium during her hospitalization which\nhad improved by her discharge, but was still present in a waxing\nand [**Doctor Last Name 688**] nature but easily treated with reorientation and\ndiscontinuation of foley catheter, telemetry, and hydration. She\ndoes have followup scheduled with her cognitive neurologist.\n\n# FEN:\npt was seen by speech and swallow who recommended:\n1. Continue current diet of thin liquids and puree.\n2. Pills whole or crushed with puree.\n3. 1:1 supervision for all POs.\n4. Give POs ONLY when patient is most awake and alert.\n5. Nutrition consult.\n6. Recommend repeat swallowing evaluation at rehab prior to\nupgrading diet.\n\n# Prophylaxis: will be on lovenox 40mg sQ daily until ealry\n[**Month (only) 547**] for DVT ppx, also d/c'ed on bowel regimen\n\n# Communication: with patient and daughter [**Name (NI) **] HCP\n[**Name (NI) 1785**] [**Name (NI) 1356**]\n[**PO Box 103136**]\n[**Location (un) 2268**], [**Numeric Identifier 103137**]\n\nHome: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 103138**]\nCell: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 103139**]\nWork: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 103140**]\n\n# Code: Full\n\n# Dispo:\nTo [**Hospital3 **]\n\nMedications on Admission:\nLipitor 20 mg daily\nTegretol 200 mg TID\nAricept 10 mg daily\nLisinopril 5 mg daily\nMeloxicam 15 mg daily\nMetformin 500 mg daily\nMethotrexate 12.5 mg weekly\nEffexor 150 mg Daily\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

You\nwere found after being down on the floor for a prolonged time.\nAs a result of the fall, you suffered a fractured right hip, as\nwell as low blood pressure which caused major stress to your\nheart and liver. Your hip fracture was surgically repaired, and\nas you were given IV fluids, the damage to your heart and liver\nimproved substantially.

Guiac\n   negative, cr 1.8 from b/l of 1.3. K+ 5.8->5.6, EKG notable for new T\n   wave inversions in V1-V4. A CT abdomen and pelvis showed urinary\n   retention and a foley catheter was placed. Perceived to have a somewhat\n   altered mental status although unclear baseline.\n   Most recent vitals at the time of transfer to the MICU were t 97 hr 90\n   bp 100/54 rr 16 sat 100% on RA. On arrival to the ICU she was calm but\n   visibly in pain.\n   Review of systems was negative for recent fever, chills, cough,\n   shortness of breath or chest pain, nausea or vomiting.\n   Patient admitted from: [**Hospital1 1**] ER\n   History obtained from Medical records\n   Patient unable to provide history: Sedated\n   Allergies:\n   No Known Drug Allergies\n   Last dose of Antibiotics:\n   Infusions:\n   Other ICU medications:\n   Other medications:\n   HOME MEDICATIONS:\n   Lipitor 20 mg daily\n   Tegretol 200 mg TID\n   Aricept 10 mg daily\n   Lisinopril 5 mg daily\n   Meloxicam 15 mg daily\n   Metformin 500 mg daily\n   Methotrexate 12.5 mg weekly\n   Effexor 150 mg Daily\n   Past medical history:\n   Family history:\n   Social History:\n   Seizure disorder (developed [**1-13**] DKA in [**2095**])\n   breast CA s/p mastectomy with prosthetic reconstruction ([**2107**])\n   IDDM\n   RA\n   HTN\n   glaucoma\n   bilat TKRs\n   Of note, neuropsych evaluation in [**2125**] commented that \"her marked\n   attentional impairments raises concerns around her safety, medication\n   compliance, and other areas of functional vulnerability.\"\n   Occupation: nurse (retired)\n   Drugs: none\n   Tobacco: none\n   Alcohol: none\n   Other: Lives alone.
