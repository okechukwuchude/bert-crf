He was admitted to the ICU.\n\nNeuro: Since the time of admission patient was arousable and\nresponded to commands. He remained at his baseline until the day\nhe decompensated when his metal status has worsened and upon\nintubation, required no sedation. He received minimal pain\nmedications for abdominal pain/discomfort.\n\nCV: The patient was initially stable from a cardiovascular\nstandpoint. He required vasopressors upon admission, in the next\n48 hours he was weaned of the pressors. He developed vasopressor\nrequirement and became hemodynamically unstable approximately 48\nhour prior to his demise. Following the aspiration event on the\nfloor level of care on [**7-10**], patient was transferred to ICU,\nwhere he drooped his systolic blood pressure shortly after. He\nwas on one vasopressor for the 24 hours, later on 2 pressors,\nyet his sbp was in 70s. The family made a decision to withdraw\nlife support including vasopressors on [**7-12**] in the early\nmid-afternoon. Patient expired several hours after.\n\nPulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary\nstandpoint initially. On [**7-10**] he vomited and aspirated. His\noxygen saturation dropped and he was transferred to the ICU. His\noxygen saturation was low, his mental status worsened, thus he\nwas intubated. He remained intubated until he expired.\n\nGI/GU/FEN: Patient was found to have C. difficile colitis. He\nwas fed via TPN. The electrolytes was initially repleated. The\nhyperkalemia was treated with kayaxylate. Patient also [**Month/Year (2) 1834**]\nCVVH. The CVVH no longer continued after [**7-10**], when patient was\nintubated, due to family wishes. Patient had diagnostis\nparacenthesis, which did not show SBP.\n\nID: He was treated for C. difficile colitis initially with PO\nvancomycin and IV flagyl as well as tigacycine. The Klebsiella\nbacteremia was treated with meropenem. Prior to the cultures\nbecoming available, patient also recieved amikacin and cefepime.\nHe was afebrile for most of the hospital stay.\n\nEndocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout\nhis stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.\n\nHematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined\nroutinely.\n\nProphylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and\nvenodyne boots were used during this stay.\n\nAs patient status declined rapidly on [**7-10**] following the\naspiration event, family made a well thought out decision to\nminimize the patient's suffering as his prognosis was not\nfavorable. Patient was initially made DNR status for about 24\nhours. Next, the family made the patient CMO with continued\nventilation on [**7-12**]. Patient expired one to hours after all the\nvasopressors were stopped. He was started on morphine gtt. He\nexpired comfortable, with no agonal breaths observed. The\nmedical examiner as well as the family refused an autopsy.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\ntylenol 500'''' prn fever, darbepoetin alpha 40 qweek, folic\nacid, HSQ, lispro sliding scale, reglan 5 iv q8, mycophenolate\n180\", nepro TF 45/hr, nystatin swish/swallow\"\", zofran prn,\npromod syrup 10ml q8, protonix 40\", bactrim', tacrolimus\n0.5/0.5,\nursodiol 300\", renal vitamin\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\npatient was CMO:\n- morphine gtt\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nmultiorgan system failure\ncardiac arrest\n\nDischarge Condition:\ndeath\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nnot applicable\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nnot applicable\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2105-7-13**]"
