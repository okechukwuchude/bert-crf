He denied any chest pain, palpitations,\nlightheadedness, syncope, lower extremity edema, fevers, chills,\ncough, or sputum production. He was treated as an acute on\nchronic CHF exacerbation with diuresis as well as a COPD\nexacerbation with steroids and nebulizers.

The LAD had diffuse 20-30% lesions throughout\nwith a\nmid vessel 80% stenosis. The Lcx had mild luminal irregularities\nwith a\nmid vessel 60% eccentric stenosis. The RCA was small and\nnondominant\nwithout any angiographically apparent stenosis.\n2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right sided filling\npressures\nwith an RVEDP of 17 mmHg. There was moderate pulmonary\nhypertension with\na pulmonary artery pressure of 47/21 mmHg. There were moderately\n\nelevated left sided filling pressures with a PCWP mean of 24\nmmHg. There\nwas normal central aortic pressures of 126/77 mmHg. The cardiac\nindex\nwas normal at 2.9 L/min/m2.\n3. Left vetriculography was deferred.\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:\n1. One vessel coronary artery disease.\n2. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.\n3. Moderate diastolic dysfunction.\n4. Elevated RVEDP\n.\nCXR ([**2131-12-24**]):\n1. Hazy opacity in the lingula and left lower lobe, concerning\nfor early pneumonia versus asymmetric edema.\n2. Cardiomegaly. Mild vascular congestion with interstitial\nedema.\n3. Right retrocardiac density, atelectasis versus pneumonia. PA\nand lateral views are recommended for better assessment of this\narea.\n.\nTTE ([**2131-12-25**]):\nThe left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial\npressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are\nnormal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There\nis severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = [**10-9**] %).\nRight ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.\nThe aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic\nvalve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic\nvalve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral\nvalve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve\nprolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is\nmild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\nIMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricular cavity with severe global\nhypokinesis. Preserved right ventricular cavity size and\nsystolic function. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary\nhypertension.\n.\nCT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**2131-12-26**]):\n1. There is no evidence of a retroperitoneal hematoma.\n2. Marked asymmetric enlargement of the proximal right thigh\nmusculature, consistent with the patient's history of a known\nhematoma.\n3. Small left greater than right pleural effusions with\nassociated compressive atelectasis of the posterior lung bases.\n4. Cholelithiasis.\n5. Extensive colonic diverticulosis without evidence of\ndiverticulitis.\n.\nFemoral Vascular U/S ([**2131-12-26**]):\nFINDINGS: There is no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or A-V fistula,\nas questioned. There is a large right groin/thigh hematoma as\nseen on CT, measuring at least 13.0 cm in greatest dimension.\nIMPRESSION: No evidence of pseudoaneurysm of AVF. Large right\ngroin/thigh hematoma.\n.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient is a 73-year-old man with severe COPD and\nrecently-diagnosed cardiomyopathy with EF 30%, who presented to\nan OSH on [**2131-12-21**] with symptoms of acute on chronic systolic\nheart failure, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization\nto assess for ischemic cardiomyopathy, which showed LAD disease.\nHe was admitted to the CCU for aspirin desensitization with plan\nfor repeat cardiac catheterization and PCI.\n.\n#. Aspirin desensitization - The patient was admitted to the CCU\novernight for aspirin desensitization. He completed the protocol\novernight, but approximately 1 hour after completion he suffered\nfrom acute-onset of severe respiratory distress with chest\ntightness and wheezing, consistent with anaphylaxis. He was\ntreated with steroids, H1- and H2-blockers, as well as\ntreatments directed at his COPD, CHF, and anxiety, with no\nimprovement, so he was intubated for respiratory failure. He was\nextubated later that day with significant improvement. He was\nseen by the Allergy consult service, who felt that this was\nconsistent with anaphylaxis, and recommended repeat\ndesensitization after a couple weeks if needed. He is stable for\ndischarge.\n.\n#. Acute on chronic systolic CHF - The patient was recently\ndiagnosed with a cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology, and was\nbeing treated for acute on chronic systolic heart failure prior\nto transfer. On transfer, he was still mildly fluid overloaded,\nso diuresis was continued with Lasix and spironolactone. Repeat\nTTE here revealed EF 15% with global LV dysfunction and no\nwall-motion-abnormalities to suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy. He\nis being discharged on Lasix and spironolactone, as well as a\nbeta-blocker and an ACE-inhibitor.\n.\n#. Coronary artery disease - The patient underwent cardiac\ncatheterization that showed a left-dominant system, an LAD with\ndiffuse 20-30% lesions throughout and mid-vessel 80% stenosis,\nand a LCx with mild luminal irregularities and mid-vessel\neccentric 60% stenosis. He was admitted for the aspirin\ndesensitization protocol as above, but given his anaphylaxis he\nis not being discharged on aspirin. It was also suggested that\nhe would need a viability study to assess for antero-apical\nmyocardial viability in preparation for a potential PCI of his\nmid-LAD lesion, but his TTE showed no wall-motion-abnormalities\nto suggest ischemia as the reason for his cardiomyopathy, so\nthere was felt to be no indication for viability study at this\ntime. He is being discharged home on Plavix, beta-blocker, and\nlisinopril.\n.\n# ? Apical thrombus - The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for\nevaluation for apical thrombus as the TTE done at OSH was unable\nto properly assess the apex. He was transferred on an IV heparin\ngtt, but TTE here showed no evidence of apical thrombus, so this\nwas discontinued. He is being discharged off of anticoagulation.\n.\n# COPD - The patient has a history of severe COPD, with mild\nwheezes on exam on admission. This was significantly worsened\nafter his intubation for anaphylaxis as above, so he was treated\nwith IV Solu-Medrol and then quickly transitioned to Prednisone\nfor a rapid taper. He was otherwise continued on Advair,\nSpiriva, and nebulizers as needed, and showed significant\nimprovement by discharge.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nHOME MEDICATIONS:\n- Plavix 75mg PO daily\n- Nexium 40mg PO daily\n- Lisinopril 10mg PO daily\n- Toprol XL 37.5mg PO daily\n- Salmeterol 50mcg 1puff INH [**Hospital1 **]\n- Spironolactone 25mg PO daily\n- Tiotropium 18mcg 1puff INH daily\n- Docusate 100mg PO daily\n.\n.\nTRANSFER MEDICATIONS:\n- Plavix 75mg PO daily\n- Lisinopril 10mg PO daily\n- Advair Diskus 250/50 1puff INH [**Hospital1 **]\n- Guaifenesin syrup 200mg QID PRN\n- SL NTG PRN\n- Tylenol PRN\n- Nexium 40mg PO daily\n- Solu-Medrol 60mg IV daily\n- Tiotropium 18mcg 1puff INH daily\n- Spironolactone 25mg PO daily\n- Toprol XL 37.5mg PO daily\n- Lasix 20mg IV BID\n- Xopenex nebs PRN\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

The\n   RCA was small and nondominant without any angiographically apparent\n   stenosis.\n   .\n   HEMODYNAMICS:  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right sided\n   filling pressures with an RVEDP of 17 mmHg. There was moderate\n   pulmonary hypertension with a pulmonary artery pressure of 47/21 mmHg.\n   There were moderately elevated left sided filling pressures with a PCWP\n   mean of 24 mmHg. There was normal central aortic pressures of 126/77\n   mmHg. The cardiac index was normal at 2.9 L/min/m2.\n   .\n   pCXR: (wetread) Mild congestive heart failure. Left lower lobe hazy\n   opacity may represent early infiltrate versus edema. Repeat exam after\n   treatment recommended. Remote right rib fractures.\n   .\n   OSH TTE (report):\n   1. Technically limited study due to poor parasternal windows.\n   2. LV chamber size mildly dilated. Severe global HK of LV. EF estimated\n   at 20-25%. Apical clot cannot be excluded.\n   3. [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2315**], RA normal.\n   4. RV chamber size and systolic function WNL.\n   5. Focal aortic leaflet calcification, no AS, trace AR.\n   6. Mild mitral annular regurgitation, mitral valve leaflets mildly\n   thickened, mild subvalvular thickening of mitral valve, moderate MR.\n   7. Mild TR, RVSP calculated at 37mmHg, mild pulmonary HTN.\n   8. Pericardium normal.\n   9. Aortic root normal.\n   .\n   OSH Chest CTA (report): No evidence of pulmonary embolus. Findings\n   consistent with COPD. New left greater than right pleural effusions\n   with scattered areas of atelectasis. Mild pericardial effusion\n   increased since prior study. Pertinent findings likely result of\n   congestive changes.\n   ECG: ECG - NSR, LBBB, LVH.\n   Telemetry - NSR w/ freq APCs and PVCs.\n   Assessment and Plan\n CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)\n   ASSESSMENT / PLAN: 73-yo man w/ severe COPD and recently-diagnosed\n   cardiomyopathy w/ EF 30%, who presented to OSH on [**2131-12-21**] w/ symptoms\n   of acute on chronic systolic heart failure, transferred here for\n   cardiac catheterization that showed LAD disease, now admitted to CCU\n   for ASA desensitization and viability study.\n   .\n   # CORONARIES: Cardiac catheterization today showed left-dominant\n   system, LAD with diffuse 20-30% lesions thoroughout with mid-vessel 80%\n   stenosis, and LCx with mild luminal irregularities with mid-vessel\n   eccentric 60% stenosis.\n   - continue Plavix, lisinopril\n   - short-acting beta-blocker given ASA desensitization protocol\n   - ASA desensitization as below\n   - viability study to assess for antero-apical myocardial viability, for\n   potential PCI of mid-LAD lesion\n   .\n   # PUMP: Recently diagnosed with cardiomyopathy of unknown cause.
