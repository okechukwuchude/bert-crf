We have raised a concern here and both renal and\n   heme consult services are to evaluate for possible TTP-HUS.  Will\n   continue with renal support with minimization of nephrotoxic\n   medications, will avoid fluid as possible, will add on urine K+ and Cl-\n   and Na+.\n   Respiratory Distress--Patient with diffuse wheezes on exam, limited\n   crackles seen, has increased RR and on CXR--has modest incresase in\n   interstitial edema noted and with significant volume challenge has\n   likely acquired some significant pulmonary edema and will need negative\n   fluid balance--will trial Lasix 40mg IV to look for response initially\n   and hope to see response.  Will move to CPAP if not tolerated. Atrovent\n   and Albuterol to continue as standing Rx with q 2-4 hours.\n   Thrombocytopenia--Significant PLT drop at 2 days into hospitalization\n   in the setting of sq heparin.  Will need to get an evaluation for\n   schistocytes as above.  If this is related to sq heparin it is early\n   and would expect type I which should resolve acutely with\n   discontinuation--will hold heparin for now and follow return of counts.\n   Diarrhea--Patient has no return of positive culture results to date and\n   has continued high volume GI output at 4 liters today.  Is consistent\n   with acute infectious source and will need to work to slow response\n   when we have confirmed source.  Patient will remain NPO for Rx at this\n   time.  Will Rx with oral rehydration therapy if possible as limited by\n   emesis.  Norovirus is certainly possible as well and are limited by\n   coffee ground emesis\n   Issues and concerns discussed on evening rounds with nursing and with\n   patient in detail.\n   Total time spent:  45 minutes\n"

Patient started drinking a few months\nago again. He was feeling fine on Saturday, ate some steamers,\nand then went home. Since sat reports haveing had profuse watery\ndiarrhea (3 enroute to transfer here from [**Hospital1 46**]), N/V. He tried\nto keep up with oral fluids but then started feeling weak all\nover with muscle cramps and so decided to come to ED.\nHe initially presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] today with complaint\nof possible reaction to seroquel and weakness. He also\ncomplained of body aches, N/V, diarrhea, and back pain. Rectal\nexam at OSH showed BRB in rectum. labs there were consistent\nwith possible septic shock with WBC 20, ABG: pH 7.11/36/143 HCO3\n10. Hct 61, ammonia 250. Also had ARF with creatinine 5.0 and\nonly 5cc UOP at [**Hospital1 46**]. He then complained of [**6-25**] chest pain\nand had a non-con CT scan to rule out dissection. Reportedly\nshowed ileus and fatty liver. He received zosyn, 2.5L NS, 8mg\nzofran, and was started on levophed. He also had a right-sided\ncentral line placed. In the meantime he was noted to have BRBPR.\nFor unclear reasons the OSH was also concerned for dissection.\nHe was then transferred to our ED for concern for\nGIB/dissection. In our ED initial vs were: T97.3 P104 BP92/59\nR20 O2 sat94%on 3L.Exam revealed only BMs with trace guaiac\npositive stool.

Bladder contents may reflect hyperconcentrated urine or\nhematuria.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n53yo M with h/o HCV and DM2 admitted with hypovolemic\nhypotension and diarrhea.\n.\n# Shock/Gastroenteritis: This was likely hypovolemic shock from\ndiarrhea, vomiting, and poor PO intake.  CT confirmed small\nbowel inflammation. He was initially supported with aggressive\nIVF and norepinephrine was stopped.  C. Diff toxin was negative\nx 6.  Stool cultures demonstrated no pathogens. His stool output\nwas initally copious, over 6L on hospital day one, but\ndecreased. HIV neg. He received IVF boluses with lactated\nringers, and maintenace fluid with NaHCO3. A colonoscopy with\nbiopsies was done and appeared grossly normal with path PENDING\nat discharge.  Without intervention, his stool output slowed.\nImmodium was started to improve loose stools even more. f/u with\nGI planned, but etiology presumed to be infectious.\n.\n# Acute Renal Failure: Baseline Cr was 0.7 from [**8-24**]. He was\ninitially anuric, and his serum creatinine rapidly increased to\na peak of 10.   Renal was consulted, and a renal u/s showed no\nobstruction. Urine electrolytes were consistent with pre-renal\netiology.  Urine sediment showed muddy brown casts c/w ATN.  On\n[**2154-1-30**], his urine output increased, with a concomitant decrease\nin stool output.  Over the following days his serum creatinine\ndecreased to 4.4, but did not return to normal.  The renal team\nfeels he should regain most of his renal function and should be\nfollowed in nephrology clinic. Urine output good.\n.\n# GIB: Per report, patient had episode of coffee ground emesis\non presentation.  Serial hematocrits initially decreased, but\nthis was likely due to dilution as he was severely hypovolemic\non arrival.  His hematocrit then stablized at 38\n.\n# Transaminitis: [**Month (only) 116**] be [**12-18**] shock or component of viral\nhepatitis. Patient already with HCV but per him has been treated\nand is in remission. Also started drinking again recently and\nmay have ETOH-hepatitis although this is usually more\ncholestatic.\nHis LFTs improved during his hospitalization.\n.\n# ETOH: Drinking a significant amount of brandy daily and with\nhistory of shakes in last day from not drinking. He was intially\ntreated with IV thiamine and folate, and then supplemented with\na multivitmain, thiamine and folate daily.  Social work was\nconsulted.  No significant etoh w/d seen.\n.\n# DM2: Patient was covered with an insulin sliding scale with\nexcellent glycemic control.\n.\n# h/o HTN: Lisinopril was held in the setting of ARF. Was not\nrestarted on discharge.\n.\n# Code Status: FULL CODE\n\nMedications on Admission:\nSeroquel 100mg daily at night\nLisinopril 10mg daily\nZoloft 50mg daily\nOmeprazole 20mg [**Hospital1 **]\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
