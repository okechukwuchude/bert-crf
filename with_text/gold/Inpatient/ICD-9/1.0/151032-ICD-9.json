Now mild to moderate pulmonary\nedema has\nmarkedly improved. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions\nare\ndecreased associated with adjacent atelectasis. Left PICC tip is\nin the upper\nto mid SVC. Sternal wires are aligned.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nPresented to emergency department tachypneic to 32-40 while on\nBiPaP and  hypotension.  She was admitted and transferred to the\nCCU at which time she was chest pain free; vitals on transfer to\nthe CCU T 98.0, HR 83, BP 105/63, RR 30, 100% on bipap. She was\nactively diuresed and put out over 4L with significant\nimprovment in pulmonary edema seen on CXR and concomitant\nimprovement in respiratory status. Given severity of AS and\nresent exacerbation, pt was evaluated for AVR and felt to need\nvalve replacement. Pre-op work-up intiated and she underwent\nrepeat CXR, carotid ultrasound and cardiac catheterization.\nCardiac catheterization revealed coronary artery disease.\n\nOn [**2146-10-25**] she was brought to the operating room and underwent\naortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass graft\nsurgery.  She received vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics\nand was trasnfered to the intensive care unit for post operative\nmanagement.  She remained intubated, as she remained lethargic\nand unable to protect airway.  She was transfused two units of\npacked red blood cells for anemia due to blood loss and\nhemodilution.  She was extubated on POD 3, by this time she had\nbeen weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support.  Beta\nblocker was initiated and she was gently diuresed toward the\npreoperative weight.  She did develop post-op atrial\nfibrillation and was treated with amiodarone, beta blocker and\nanti-coagulation for a goal INR 2-2.5.  Additionally, she\ndeveloped bilateral weakness of upper and lower extremities.\nThe patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further\nrecovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued\nwithout complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical\ntherapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By\nthe time of discharge on POD 8 she remained weak, ambulating few\nfeet with walker and assistance.  She was discharged to [**Hospital 100**]\nrehab MACU on telemetry due to continued atrial fibrillation.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nATORVASTATIN 40 mg PO daily\nHYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE 25 mg PO daily\nLISINOPRIL 60 mg PO daily\nMETFORMIN 1,000 mg PO BID\nPANTOPRAZOLE - 40 mg PO BID\nSUCRALFATE 1 gram Q6H\nASPIRIN 81 mg PO daily\nCALCIUM CARBONATE-VITAMIN D3\nOMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
