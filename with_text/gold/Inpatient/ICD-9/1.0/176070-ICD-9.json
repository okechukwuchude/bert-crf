Pylorus-Preserving Pancreaticoduodenectomy\n2. Harvest of left internal jugular vein and portal vein\nexcision with reconstruction\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\nThe patient is a very pleasant 77-year-old who had presented in\n[**Month (only) 958**] with acute pancreatitis.  On imaging studies, he was noted\nto have a mass in the head of the pancreas. He subsequently\nunderwent endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration.\nCytology on these aspirates was nondiagnostic. He\nsubsequently developed obstructive jaundice and on [**Month (only) **], he was\nnoted to have a biliary stricture.  A biliary stent was placed.\nHe underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy with a presumed\ndiagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis.  The subsequent CT scan\nimages showed complete resolution of pancreas mass.  However,\nrepeat [**Month (only) **] showed persistence of biliary stricture.  Brushings\nof the biliary stricture are suspicious for adenocarcinoma. The\npatient is well known for Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and she was followed the\npatient along. The patient also had cholecystectomy done with\nDr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in the past. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] evaluated the patient for\npossible Whipple procedure secondary to highly suspicious\nbrushing results. During the evaluation all risks, goals and\nbenefits were discussed with the patient and his family, and\npatient was scheduled for elective Whipple on [**2191-6-24**].\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nPMH: HTN, vertigo episodes x2, Giant cell arteritis [**2188**], CAD\n\nPSH: lap CCY [**2191-5-19**]\n\n\nSocial History:\nHe has an 18-pack-year history of tobacco, but quit 13 years\nago.  He drinks alcohol only occasionally.  There are no\nenvironmental exposures.\n\n\nFamily History:\nMr. [**Known lastname 92312**] reports a family history of pancreatic cancer.  His\nsister died of it at age [**Age over 90 **].  There is no other history of\npancreatic disease or GI malignancy.\n\n\nPhysical Exam:\nOn Discharge:\nVS: 98.6, 70, 138/69, 12, 95% RA\nGEN: Pleasan with NAD\nNECK: Left longitudinal incision open to air with steri strips\nand c/d/i\nCV: RRR\nRESP: CTAB\nABD: Bilateral subcostal incision open to air with staples,\nminimal erythema on middle portion of incision.

Patent main and right portal veins.  Flow within the left\nportal vein could not be detected.  This could be due to\ntechnical factors or slow flow, however a thrombosed LPV cannot\nbe excluded.\n2. Pneumobilia\n3. Right pleural effusion.\n\n[**2191-6-29**] ABD CT:\nIMPRESSION:\n1.  Patent main, left and right portal veins; however, some\nnon-critical\nnarrowing of the presumed graft.\n2.  Small non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions with adjacent\ncompressive\natelectasis.\n3.  Generalized anasarca.\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on\n[**2191-6-24**] for elective Whipple procedure. On same day, the\npatient underwent pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy\n(Whipple) and portal vein excision with reconstruction, which\nwent well without complication. The patient was transferred in\nICU after operation for observation. On POD # 1, patient was\nextubated and was transferred on the floor NPO with an NG tube,\non IV fluids, with a foley catheter and a JP x 2 drain in place,\nand epidural catheter for pain control.  The patient was\nhemodynamically stable.\nNeuro: The patient received Fentanyl/Bupivacaine via epidural\ncatheter with good effect and adequate pain control.  When\ntolerating oral intake, the patient was transitioned to oral\npain medications.\nCV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Metoprolol was\nrestarted on POD # 1. On POD # 2, patient was started on Aspirin\n325 mg daily per Vascular Surgery, he was discharge home on this\nmedication as well.\nPulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary\ntoilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were\nencouraged throughout hospitalization.\nGI: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV fluids.\nDiet was advanced when appropriate, which was well tolerated.\nPatient's intake and output were closely monitored, and IV fluid\nwas adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were routinely\nfollowed, and repleted when necessary. The patient had two JP\ndrains placed intraoperatively. On POD # 4, one JP output\nincreased up to 1 L and patient underwent liver doppler to rule\nout portal vein obstruction. The doppler revealed patent main\nand right portal veins, but left portal vein was doppler was\nlimited. The patient's JP # 1 output still high, JP bilirubin\nwas sent and was elevated (7). On POD # 5, patient underwent\nabdominal CT which demonstrated patent main, left and right\nportal veins; however, some non-critical narrowing of the\npresumed graft. The patient's JP output was started to slow\ndown. On POD # 6 JP amylase was sent from both drains and was\nnormal. The patient was discharged home with both JP to continue\nmonitor their output.\nGU: The foley catheter discontinued at midnight of POD#4. The\npatient subsequently voided without problem.\nID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were\nclosely watched for signs of infection. Wound was evaluated\ndaily and small area of erythema was noticed on the middle part\nof the incision on POD # 3. The erythema subsided prior\ndischarge, and though to be cause by staples.\nEndocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout\nhis stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly. No insulin\nwas needed upon discharge.\nHematology: The patient was transfused with 2 units of pRBC\nintraoperatively secondary to blood loss. Post op patient's\ncomplete blood count was examined routinely; no further\ntransfusions were required.\nProphylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and\nvenodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get\nup and ambulate as early as possible.\nAt the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile\nwith stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular\ndiet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well\ncontrolled.  The patient received discharge teaching and\nfollow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and\nagreement with the discharge plan.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nDiazepam 5mg PRN; Lisinopril 5mg'; Metoprolol tartrate 12.5mg'';\nPercocet PRN; ASA 81mg'; Calcium carbonate; Vitamin D3; Centrum\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\nDisp:*60 Capsule(s)* Refills:*2*\n2. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a\nday) as needed for constipation.\n3. hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4\nhours) as needed for pain.\nDisp:*80 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n4. acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q 8H\n(Every 8 Hours).\n5. metoprolol tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\n6. aspirin 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n7. pantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
