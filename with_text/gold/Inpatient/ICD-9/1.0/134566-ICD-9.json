There is little overall change in the appearance of the\nheart and\nlungs and monitoring and support devices. Bilateral pleural\neffusions with\nbibasilar atelectasis are again seen. Some indistinctness of\npulmonary\nvessels again is consistent with some elevation in pulmonary\nvenous pressure.\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname 93756**] was admitted from the ED on [**2119-10-3**] with hypotension\nand tachycardia. While in the ED he was given a fluid challenge\nwith a good response He was re-started back on his previous\nantibiotics meropenum for multidrug resistant Klebsiella\nbacteremia and Proteus bacteremia, and Linezolid for VRE UTI. He\nwas pancultured. RUQ ultrasound showed a dilated gallbladder.\nCT Torso showed small bowel which has herniated through the\ndiaphgragmatic hiatus adjacent to the gastric pull-up.  A\nportion of pancreas also appears to be above the diaphragm.  On\n[**2119-10-7**] he had Flexible upper endoscopy with endoscopic\nplacement of nasogastric tube (which he pulled out and was later\nreplaced). A fistula could not be visualized but we could\nclearly see the Jagwire as it entered the stomach about a\ncentimeter below the esophagogastric anastomosis, therefore\nidentifying the fistula location.\n\nID:  Was consulted and recommended continue previous\nantibiotics.  Repeat BAL. Cultures only growing Proteus and\nKlebs. Urine culture was negative therefore Linezolid was\nstopped on [**2119-10-8**].  Pt's white count and fever curve improved\nover the next week and a half, and his antibiotic regimen was\nthen stopped on [**10-17**].  On [**10-27**], the patient was thought to\nhave aspirated some of his bilious NGT secretions, and a WBC to\n14 was noted.  Proteus and Klebsiella were again found in the\nsputum and GU tract cultures, and the patient was given a 10d\ncourse of meropenem which ended on [**11-7**].  The patient has been\nafebrile since with a normal WBC count.\n\nRespiratory: Pt intially placed on mechanical ventilation on\nadmission for low 02 saturations.  Weaned to CPAP 8/5 with\noxygen saturations of 98%, eventually progressed to tolerating\nonly Trach piece by [**10-24**].  On [**10-27**], pt desaturated in the\nsetting of presumed aspiration.  Bronchoscopy yielded only\nminimal thin secretions, pt required CMV for adequate\noxygenation.  Weaned again to trach piece by [**11-1**], but then a\ntrip to the operating room for EGD/wound vac placement resulted\nin the patient being placed on CMV and CPAP for 2-3 days.  By\n[**11-8**], the patient had been able to tolerate trach piece\nventilation for multiple hours a day, mainly needing minimal\nCPAP assistance at night.\n\nGI: on [**10-13**], the patient was taken to the operating room for\nhiatal hernia repair for ? colonic obstruction in the setting of\nlarge amounts of NGT output.  An abdominal CT scan showed\nherniation of the transverse colon and part of the pancreas into\nthe thoracic cavity.  The abdomen was left open after this\noperation due to concerns that his large amount of ascites and\nincreased abdominal pressure would not allow for adequate\nclosure.  On [**10-17**], a [**State 19827**] patch was placed to facilitate\nstepwise abdominal closure.  After hernia repair and [**State **]\npatch placement, the patient continued to have copious bilious\ndrainage from the NGT placed in the gastric conduit and\nintolerance of NGT clamping.  A SBFT study was obtained on [**10-27**]\nwhich showed no contrast movement through the pylorus.  The\npatient was taken to the operating room on [**11-1**] for an EGD,\nwhich showed that the likely source of the patient's obstructive\nsymptoms was a \"hairpin turn\" like kink in his proximal\nduodenum, just after the pylorus.  This area was dilated with a\nballoon.  His NGT output decreased over the next 3 days, and his\nNGT was eventually removed.  During the same operation on [**11-1**],\nthe patient's midline abdominal wound was assessed.  It was\nconcluded that the [**State 19827**] Patch was no longer able to preserve\nthe patient's abdominal domain, and it was exchanged for a wound\nvac.  The wound vac was changed every 3 days following it's\ninitial placement with no issues.\n\nNutrition: Tube feeds were intially stopped due to bilious NG\noutput.  Restarted and goal was reached by [**10-23**].  Held and\nrestarted on [**11-1**] for his operation and advanced to goal\nwithout issues.\n\nHeme: Pt received a total of 6U PRBC and 6 vials of albumin over\nthe course of his hospital stay for both low hematocrit and low\nintravascular volume.\n\nPICC: right PICC placed [**2119-9-22**]: terminates\n\nMedications on Admission:\nAcetylcysteine 20%\nAlbuterol Inhaler\nAlbuterol Sulfate (Extended Release)\nLansoprazole 30 mg Daily\nHeparin HSQ\nIpratropium Bromide MDI\nLevothyroxine Sodium 75 mcg\nMetoprolol Tartrate\nNystatin Oral Suspension\nOxycodone-Acetaminophen 5/325 q4-6 PRN pain\nMetoclopramide 5mg Q6H\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. heparin (porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution Sig: One (1) dose\nInjection [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day).\n2. citalopram 20 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO DAILY (Daily): via\nJ-tube.\n3. fentanyl 25 mcg/hr Patch 72 hr Sig: One (1) Patch 72 hr\nTransdermal Q72H (every 72 hours).\n4. oxycodone 5 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: Five (5) mL PO Q6H (every 6\nhours) as needed for pain.\n5. famotidine(PF) in [**Doctor First Name **] (iso-os) 20 mg/50 mL Piggyback Sig: One\n(1) dose Intravenous Q12H (every 12 hours).\n6. heparin, porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe Sig: Two (2) ML\nIntravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush: flush with\n10 cc of normal saline followed by heparin.\n7. levothyroxine 200 mcg Recon Soln Sig: 37.5 mcg Injection\nDAILY (Daily).\n8. hydromorphone (PF) 1 mg/mL Syringe Sig: One (1)  Injection\nQ2H (every 2 hours) as needed for pain.\n9.
