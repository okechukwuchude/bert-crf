He was sent for an echo which\nrevealed low-normal systolic function with\nan EF of 50-55%. He was sent for a Persantine Stress which\nrevealed a large previous infarct in the anterior and\nanteroseptal walls extending from the mild LV to the apex with\nmild peri-infarct ischemia. He does report 2 very brief\nepisodes of a gurgling sensation around his breast bone several\nmonths occur. Each episode lasted only seconds, occurred while\nlying down, with no associated symptoms, and resolved on its\nown. He is overall very sedentary. He has been overweight and\nhas never exercised. He fell down a couple stairs last week and\ninjured his left foot. He still has localized swelling. An XRAY\ndid not reveal any fracture.

See operative report\nfor further details.  Post operatively he was taken to the\nintensive care unit for management.  In the first twenty four\nhours he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact\nand was extubated without complications.  Of note he initially\nwas in complete heart block requiring epicardial pacing but his\nrhythm recovered and went into atrial fibrillation.  He was\ntreated with amiodarone, which converted back to sinus rhythm.\nBetablockers were held and he was continued on amiodarone with\nintermittent short burst of atrial fibrillation.  He was started\non coumadin for anticoagulation due to ongoing episodes of\natrial fibrillation.  Physical therapy worked with him on\nstrength and mobility.  On post opeerative day five he was\nstarted on low dose betablockers which he tolerated.  He\ncontinued to do well and was ready for discharge to rehab on\ntelemetry on post operative day six to [**Hospital6 **].\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1. simvastatin 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\n2. aspirin 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n3. mupirocin calcium 2 % Ointment Sig: One (1) Appl Nasal [**Hospital1 **] (2\n\ntimes a day) for 5 days: Please swab in nose for 5 days before\nsurgery. .\nDisp:*1 tube* Refills:*0*\n4. metoprolol succinate 25 mg Tablet Extended Release 24 hr Sig:\n\nOne (1) Tablet Extended Release 24 hr PO once a day.\nDisp:*30 Tablet Extended Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2*\n5.
