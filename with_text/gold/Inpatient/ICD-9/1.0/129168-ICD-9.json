Mild spontaneous [**Month/Day/Year 113**]\ncontrast is present in the left atrial appendage. The left\natrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). The\nright atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D\nor color Doppler. The coronary sinus is dilated (diameter\n>15mm). Injection of agitated saline into the left upper\nextremity appeared in the right atrium through the superior vena\ncava, ruling out a persistent left SVC. The left ventricular\ncavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a\nfocal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).\n[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely not as\ngood given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Left\nventricular dysnchrony is present. The right ventricular cavity\nis dilated with mild hypokinesis of the basilar portion but\nsevere mid and apical free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal\nseptal motion/position consistent with right ventricular\npressure/volume overload. There are simple atheroma in the\naortic arch. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.\nThe descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are\nsimple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are\nthree aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are\nmoderately thickened. The non-coronary cusp is immobilized.\nThere is mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.3\ncm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The prosthetic mitral\nvalve leaflets are thickened. Motion of the prosthetic mitral\nvalve leaflets is abnormal. The leaflets appear to be fused at\ntheir bases. The gradients are higher than expected for this\ntype of prosthesis. There is severe valvular mitral stenosis\n(area <1.0cm2). Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The\nvalve ring appears somewhat more mobile than expected but there\nis no perivalvualr leak and no evidence of dehiscence. The\ntricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid\nregurgitation is at least mild to moderate. At times it may be\nslightly worse and emanates from the center of the valve. There\nis a large left pleural effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in\nperson of the results in the operating room at the time of the\nstudy.\nPOST BYPASS The patient is being AV placed. The patient is\nreceiving milrinone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine by\ninfusion. The right ventricle displays improved systolic\nfunction with mild free wall hypokinesis. The left ventricle is\nhyperdynamic with an ejection fraction near 75 to 80%. There is\na bioprosthesis in the mitral position. It appears well seated\nwith normal leaflet function. There is trace valvular mitral\nregurgitation. No perivalvular regurgitation is seen. The\nmaximum gradient through the mitral valve is 12 mmHg with a mean\ngradient of 5 mmHg at a cardiac output of about 5.7\nliters/minute. The tricuspid regurgitation is significantly\nimproved and is now mild. The aortic valve is unchanged. The\nthoracic aorta appears intact.\nCHEST (PA & LAT)   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 83784**]\nFinal Report\nPA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: Comparison is made to multiple\nprior\nradiographs, most recently [**12-15**] and [**2104-12-18**]. Lung\nvolumes\nremain low without evidence of pneumothorax and with unchanged\npositioning to left-sided pacemaker and right Port-A-Cath. Left\npleural effusion has\nincreased in the interval with expected probable adjacent\ncompression\natelectasis. Mild right basilar atelectasis is improved with\nstable\neventration of the hemidiaphragms. Cardiac silhouette remains\nenlarged with no other change to mediastinal and hilar contours.\nThe epicardial pacing leads as well as right central venous line\nhave been removed in the interval.\nDegenerative changes involving the right humeral head are again\nnoted.\nIMPRESSION:\nMarked interval increase in size to moderate left pleural\neffusion and small right pleural effusion.\nThe study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.\n\nDR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]\nDR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3891**]\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n76F who underwent mitral valve replacement in [**2097**] who had\ndeveloped progressive fatigue and dyspnea since [**2104-7-29**].\nShe also developed lower extremity edema.  She was found to have\nsevere MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 113**] as well as 3+MR and pulmonary hypertension\nwith PA pressures in the 50s.  She underwent cardiac\ncatheterization at outside hospital, which showed no coronary\nartery disease.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and on [**2104-12-16**]\nunderwent a redo sternotomy and redo mitral valve replacement\nwith a 29-mm St. [**Hospital 923**] Medical Biocor tissue valve. Her bypass\ntime was 108 minutes with a crossclamp time of 66 minutes. See\noperative note for full details.  She tolerated the operation\nbut required inotropic and pressor support post operatively, she\nwas transferred from the operating room to the cardiac surgery\nICU in stable condition on epinephrine, Milrinone and Levophed.\nVasopressin was added and Levophed was weaned to off on the\noperative day. On the morning of POD1 sedation was weaned and\nshe was extubated. She was continued on milronone until post\noperative day 4 due to right ventricular dysfunction.  She did\nhave acute tubular nephrosis with a peak creatinine of 2.4.  The\nrenal team was consulted.  The patient was started on Natrecor\nand Lasix drips with increased diuresis.  The drips were\ndiscontinued on post operative day 4 and she continued to\ndiurese with Lasix daily. Her renal function continued to\nimprove with creatinine returning to baseline prior to\ndischarge. Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per cardiac\nsurgery protocol.  Physical therapy worked with her to improve\nstrength and endurance.  She was transferred to the floor on\npost operative day 6 (held in the unit one extra day due to bed\navailability).  The patient continued to progress slowly with\nphysical therapy and was found ready for transfer to rehab on\nPOD 8.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nAt home: Levoxyl 25mcg', Ambien 5 prn, Norvasc 2.5'\nOn admission: Lorazepam 0.5 q6h prn, Amiodarone 200', Aspirin\n81', Bisacodyl 10', Mylanta 30 q4h prn, Ambien 5 prn, Enoxaparin\n40 hs, Acetylcysteine 600mg 2 doses, Lasix 40 x1\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
