The left\nventricular cavity is dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic\nfunction is severely depressed (LVEF= 15 %) secondary to\nextensive apical akinesis, inferior posterior akinesis, and\nseptal akinesis with focal dyskinesis. The right ventricular\nfree wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is\nnormal. with borderline normal free wall function. [Intrinsic\nright ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed\ngiven the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There are focal\ncalcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)\nare mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are\nmildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)\nmitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are\nmildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid\nregurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery\nsystolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nCath [**2147-11-20**]\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:\n1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.\n2. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.\n3. Inferior wall STEMI.\n4. Acute occlusion at the level of mid-RCA successfully treated\nwith a\nbare metal Vision stent(3.0 x 12 mm).\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nASSESSMENT & PLAN:\n76 year-old female with a past medical history of diabetes who\npresented to her PCP's office with worsening DOE x 4-6 weeks,\nfound to have ST elevations in inferior leads and now s/p BMS to\nmid-RCA, 3-vessel disease on cath.\n.\n# Acute systolic CHF: A post cath ECHO showed that the patient\nhad an EF of 15% with apical/septal/poterior AK and focal DK.\nAlso has 3+ TR and 1+MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 17221**] than being an acute change, her\npoor heart function was though to be a more chronic progression\nover thelast few months.  This is consistent with the patient's\ndescription of NHYA class [**3-2**] symptoms at home. The patient\ninitially had crackles on exam, that improved during the\nhospitalization, as well as no peripheral edema.  Initially the\npatient was very tachypneic during the cath, and was intubated.\nShe also received 40 mg IV lasix at the time and made good\nurine.  Her respiratory status continued to improve as fluid was\ntaken off. The patient did no have an oxygen requirment on\ndischarge, and was sent home on Torsemide 40 mg daily.  The\npatient was also medically optimized for her CHF and started on\nmetoprolol, atorvastatin, and her home lisinopril dose was\nincreased.  She was also started on spironolactone.  The patient\nshould have a repeat ECHO in about one month to assess for any\nchanges in her heart failure now that she has been started on a\nheart failure medication regimen.\n.\n# Inf MI:  The patient was found to have old Q waves in the\ninferior leads, as well as new ST elevations in II, III, and\naVF.  The patient did not make troponins, with peak being 0.04.\nShe was taken to the cath lab and found to have a 100% occlusion\nof the RCA, and a BMS was placed over this lesion.  She also had\na 90% diag, 90% mid LAD, 90% mid Lcx. Other vessels not stented\nbecause of distal nature of occlusions.  The patient was started\non ASA 325 mg, as well as plavix 75 mg for at least one month.\nPost procedure, the patient was continued on integrillin drip\nfor 18 hours.  The patient was found to have an A1c of 6.4. Her\nlipid panel showed TC 90, TG 100, HDL 38, and LDL of 32.  The\npatient was started on atorvastatin 80 mg daily.\n.\n# elevated wedge/respiratory status: Pt was increasingly\ntachypneic prior to cath and was intubated, on assist control\nwith TV 450 cc, resp rate 16, PEEP 5, on 60% FIO2. Also found to\nhave right heart cath notable for a PCWP 31, PA oressures 54/32.\nShe was given 40 mg IV Lasix and transferred to the CCU\nintubated.  Right heart cath notable for a PCWP 31, PA oressures\n54/32.  She was given 40 mg IV Lasix and transferred to the CCU\nintubated.  The patient was extubated the next morning, and\ndiuresis was continued, and her respiratory status continued to\nimprove.  The patient was discharged on torsemide, and was\ninstructed to follow up labs as an outpatient.\n.\n# HTN:  The patient's home dose of lisinopril was increased from\n2.5 mg daily to 5 mg daily, and she was started on metoprolol\n12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **], that was later transitioned to 50 mg of metoprolol\nsuccinate daily.  The patient was also started on spironlactone\n12.5 daily.\n.\n# Diabetes type 2: The patient was taken metformin at home; it\nwas held during the hospitalization and she was kept on humalog\nsliding scale.  While in patient, she required minimal amounts\nof insulin and A1c was found to be 6.4.  She was discharged on\nher home dose of metformin.\n.\n# Psoriatic Arthritis:  The patient was continued on her home\ndose of methotrexate.  She has a rheumatologist at NWH who\nfollows her.\n.\n# Depression/mood disorder: The patient is followed by\noutpatient psychiatrist.  Her lithium and effexor were initially\nheld, but then restarted after she was extubated.  The patient\nhad a lithium level that was checked, which was normal.\n..\nTransitional Issues:\n- the patient will need to have her lytes checked on [**12-1**] and\nhave her results faxed to her primary care doctor's office.\n- the patient will need to have a repeat ECHO done, as she has\nbeen started on medications for her heart failure.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nLisinopril 2.5mg PO Daily\nMetformin 850mg PO BID\nMethotrexate 2.5mg tabs 6 tabs by mouth once weekly\nFolic acid 1mg PO daily\nEffexor 75mg PO TID\nLithium 300mg tabs, 2 tabs by mouth [**Hospital1 **] (1200mg total) (managed\nby Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 85917**]\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. clopidogrel 75 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n2. folic acid 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n\n3. atorvastatin 80 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n4. aspirin 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n5. spironolactone 25 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n6. venlafaxine 75 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times\na day).\n7. lithium carbonate 300 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Capsule PO BID\n(2 times a day).\n8. metformin 850 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a\nday).\n9. lisinopril 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n10. metoprolol succinate 50 mg Tablet Extended Release 24 hr\nSig: One (1) Tablet Extended Release 24 hr PO once a day.\nDisp:*30 Tablet Extended Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2*\n11. torsemide 20 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO once a day.\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n12.

You had some\nchanges on your ECG and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a cardiac\ncatheterization. A stent was placed in your right coronary\nartery and you have other blockages that were not fixed at this\ntime. You were started on aspirin and clopidogrel, Plavix, to\nkeep the stent from clotting off. Do not stop taking plavix or\naspirin for any reason unless Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] tells you it is OK. You\nrisk having another heart attack if you do not take these\nmedicines. The plan is to treat you with medicines to help your\nheart pump better and recover from the heart attack. Your heart\nfunction is very weak after the heart attack and you will need\nto take all of your medicines every day and check for any fluid\nbuild up. Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes\nup more than 3 lbs.You also need to follow a low sodium diet.\n.\nWe made the following changes to your medicines:\n1. START taking aspirin 325mg (not baby) and clopidogrel every\nday for at least one month and possibly longer to keep the stent\nfrom clotting off\n2. START taking metoprolol to lower your heart rate and help\nyour heart pump better.\n3. Increase the lisinopril to lower your blood pressure and help\nyour heart pump better\n4. START taking atorvastatin to lower your cholesterol\n5. START taking spironolactone daily to help your heart pump\nbetter\n6. START taking torsemide daily to get rid of extra fluid\n\nPlease have electrolytes checked with your primary care\nphysician [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 483**].
