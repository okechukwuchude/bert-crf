Images were displayed in\n multiple planes.\n\n FINDINGS:  The exam is limited by suboptimal contrast bolus timing.\n\n There is an extensive type-A aortic dissection extending from the aortic root,\n to the descending and abdominal aorta, to the level of the infrarenal\n abdominal aorta.  Evaluation for carotid extension is severely limited by poor\n contrast bolus timing and streak artifact through the neck.  The dissection at\n least extends into the proximal left subclavian and into the proximal right\n brachiocephalic artery. Approximately 1.2 cm distal to the right\n brachiocephalic origin, there is a 1.3 x 0.6 cm outpouching (300b:18) which\n may represent a pseudoaneurysm.  Extension into the right common carotid\n cannot be assessed.  The celiac, SMA and right and left renal arteries\n originate from the true lumen.  The [**Female First Name (un) **] originates from the true lumen.\n\n There is no hemopericardium.

The airways are patent to the\n subsegmental level.  An endotracheal tube ends in the upper trachea.\n\n ABDOMEN:  The liver parenchyma is homogeneous.  The gallbladder is thin-walled\n and not distended.  The pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.\n The kidneys enhance symmetrically.  The stomach, small and large bowel are of\n normal caliber and appearance.\n\n PELVIS:  Diffuse diverticulosis is seen throughout the colon.   There is a\n right inguinal hernia (2:35) containing loops of small bowel with mild\n fecalization, but no wall thickening or adjacent stranding.  There is no free\n pelvic fluid.  There is no inguinal or pelvic adenopathy.  The appendix is\n normal.\n\n BONE WINDOWS:  There are moderate multilevel degenerative changes throughout\n the thoracolumbar spine.  No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n 1.  Extensive type-A dissection extending from the aortic root to the\n infrarenal abdominal aorta.  The dissection extends into the proximal left\n subclavian and right brachiocephalic arteries.  There is a small thrombosed\n pseudoaneurysm in the proximal right brachiocephalic artery.  Evaluation for\n extension into the common carotid arteries is markedly limited by poor\n contrast bolus timing.
