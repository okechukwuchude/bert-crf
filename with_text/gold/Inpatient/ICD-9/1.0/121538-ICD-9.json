The patient is s/p aortic\nvalvuloplasty in [**2117**] after she was not felt to be a candidate\nfor cardiac surgery. She also has dilated cardiomyopathy with an\nEF of 20%. She is s/p biventricular ICD placement in [**2117**] with\nrecent generator change performed [**2121-7-8**]. She has been\nexperiencing increased shortness of breath with minimal exertion\nand recently underwent right and left heart catheterization by\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**2121-7-9**] which demonstrated low gradient/low flow\naortic stenosis, severe pulmonary hypertension with an elevated\nPCWP(=36 mmHg), and acute on chronic systolic and diastolic\nheart failure. Patient is on warfarin which was stopped [**2121-8-23**]\nper Dr.[**Name (NI) 32659**] instructions. Patient is now referred for right\nand left heart catheterization with aortic valvuloplasty and\nechocardiogram during the procedure.\n.\nThe patient does not have any chest pain or PND. She has 2\npillow orthopnea. Occassional lower extremity edema. No\ndizziness. She walks at home with a cane, but her ambulation is\nlimited, more by pain in her leg than by dyspnea. She had a\nmechanical fall in [**2120-9-21**] leading to ORIF for a right\nsupracondylar femur fracture. She does feel fatigued and SOB\nwith minimal activity, such as dressing herself. Her boyfriend\n[**Name (NI) 12239**] is also her caretaker and ensures that she takes all her\nmedications every day. She has had no falls in [**2120**], but the\nyear prior she had the mechanical fall leading to the femur\nfracture, as well as 4 episodes of syncope/LOC attributed to\nTikosyn, which has since been stopped.\n.\nPrior Diagnostics:\n[**2121-7-9**]: Cardiac Cath\n-Low gradient (31), low flow aortic stenosis (valve area 0.52)\n-Insignificant coronary artery disease (30% stenosis in mid LAD\nsecond diagonal branch, and RCA proximal)\n-Severe pulmonary hypertension with an elevated PCWP(=36 mmHg),\nRA pressure of 17, PA 73/28 (45)\n-Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure\n.\n[**2121-7-10**] Echo: left ventricular EF 20% (severe global systolic\ndysfunction), left atrium moderately dilated, left ventricle\nmoderately dilated, right ventricle size normal with NML free\nwall motion, critical aortical valve area (<0.8), mild (1+)\naortic regurg, moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurg, 2+\ntricuspid regerg, moderate pulm systolic HTN\n.\n[**5-/2121**]: PASP 43mmHg. Mean gradient 33mmHg.\n.\nIn the cath lab, initial vitals were 70, 93/49, 23, 98% (on RA).\nThough the patient has an ICD, a temporary pacing wire was\ninserted via catheter in order to rapidly pace her heart in\norder to empty out the left ventricle prior to valvuloplasty.\nHowever, the rapid pacing caused the patient to go into V tach.\nChest compressions were started (for 20 sec), and she was\nshocked, which resolved the arrythmia. She was briefly on Neo\nand dopamine during the procedure, but these were taken off soon\nafter the catheterization with SBPs in the 110s and MAPs in the\n60s. Valvuloplasty was performed with 3-4 inflations of a 23mm\nballoon. The gradient was decreased from 38 to 28, and the valve\narea was increased from 0.38cm2 to 0.56cm2. PCWP was measured to\nbe 26. The sheaths were removed.\n.\nVitals on transfer to the CCU were 70, 114/49, 20, and 99% (on\n2L by NC?).\n.\nOn arrival to the floor, patient was feeling well and denied\nchest pain or SOB. She had mild pain at her ICD and mild pain\natt the femoral catheter site.\n\nPast Medical History:\n- Hyperlipidemia\n- Hypertension\n- Diabetes Mellitus on insulin\n- Dilated cardiomyopathy\n- Aortic stenosis s/p csurg evaluation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**2117**]; not\na surgical candidate\n- S/P aortic valvuloplasty [**5-/2118**]\n- Cath [**2120**]: non-obstructive/non-significant CAD\n- BIV/ICD placed [**2117**] and [**Company 1543**] generator change [**2121-7-8**]\n- Open reduction/internal fixation of right femur after\nmechanical fall\n- Chronic kidney disease\n- Thyroid disease\n- S/P shingles\n- Short term memory issues\n\nFamily History:\nSON s/p MI at AGE 49, DAUGHTER WITH DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY,\nMOTHER WITH CAD AND MIs- died age 79.\n\n\nPhysical Exam:\nVS: T=97.7, BP=116/53 (69), HR=73, RR=13, O2 sat=97% on 2L by NC\n\nGENERAL: cachectic, frail, NAD.

The right atrium is\nmoderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular\nhypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.\nOverall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed\n(LVEF = 25 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left\nventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right\nventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular\nchamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall\nfunction. Significant aortic stenosis is present (not\nquantified). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The\nmitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral\nvalve prolapse. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve\nchordae. Mild to moderate ([**12-23**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.\n[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation\nmay be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve\nleaflets are mildly thickened. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the\nseverity of tricuspid regurgitation may be significantly\nUNDERestimated.] Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.\nThere is no pericardial effusion.\n.\nCompared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)\nof [**2121-7-10**], the transaortic valvular pressure gradients are\nsimilar, but the left ventricular stroke volume is higher.\nTherefore, the aortic valve orifice area is increased, although\nit could not be calculated with vertainty due to technical\nfactors. The mitral regurgitation appears significantly reduced,\nalthough the aortic regurgitation is increased.\n.\n.\nCardiac Catheterization [**2121-8-28**]:\nThe right and left heart pressures were elevated (mean PAP 35,\nPCWP 26).  The heart was 86 bpm, the CO was 2.65 L/min, mean\ngradient 38.25 mmHg, and the aortic valve area was 0.38 cm2.\n.\nInterventional details\nDuring test rapid ventricular pacing, the patient developed\nventricular tachycardia that degenerated into ventricular\nfibrillation.

The measured LV threshold was 0.5 V @ 1.0 ms. The\npatient's LV amplitude was previously set at 1.25V @ 1.0 ms, so\nthe LV amplitude was decreased to 1.0 V @ 1.0 ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] her\nsymptoms.\n.\nSummary (normal / abnormal device function):\nNormally functioning biventricular ICD. Intermittent\ndiaphragmatic pacing due to high LV thresholds which where were\ndecreased as noted above.  Patient has device clinic follow-up\nin a few weeks.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n76F with severe aortic stenosis, biventricular diastolic heart\nfailure, atrial fibrillation on warfarin and s/p dual-chamber\npacemaker, and dilated cardiomyapathy who presents to the CCU\nafter having a right and left heart catheterizaton with aortic\nvalvuloplasty in the setting in increased SOB.\n.\n# Aortic Stenosis: Pt was turned down for cardiac surgery in\n[**2117**] and had an aortic valvuloplasty at that time. Recently had\nworsening SOB and presented for elective valvuloplasty; the\nvalvuloplasty increased her aortic area by 50% and decreased the\ngradient from 38 to 28.  Given the risk of serious complications\nfollowing her procedure, she was admitted to the CCU for 24\nhours of monitoring.  She did well in the CCU after the\nvalvuloplasty.  She did not complain of SOB or chest pain and\nhad no bleeding from the femoral catheter insertion site.\nPost-cath labs were reassuring.  She was discharged with follow\nup with her PCP (Dr. [**Name (NI) 23019**]), her primary cardiologist\n(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and the interventional cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She\nalso has an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who has been\nfollowing her for her ICD.\n.\n# Biventricular ICD/Rhythm: s/p successful generator change in\n[**Month (only) 205**] with hematoma since this procedure, which is slowly\nresolving according to the patient and her significant other.\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] has been following this in the outpatient setting.\nThe patient has known a fib and is on warfarin (was held this\nweek prior to procedure). She had a brief episode of v tach in\nthe setting of rapid pacing in the cath lab, but she had not\nsuch episodes afterwards.  While in the CCU, the patient\ncomplained of a sensation of a beat in her epigastrum that was\nconcerning for diaphragmatic pacing.  Her device was\ninterrrogated and adjusted (see results section), and she will\nfollow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] next week.  She was continued on her\nhome amiodarone and metoprolol during her hospital stay.  Her\nwarfarin was held prior to the cardiac cath, but it was\nrestarted in the CCU.  She will follow up with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **]\nfor INR/warfarin monitoring and adjustments.\n.\n# Chronic Systolic and Diastolic Heart Failure: Pt has dilated\ncardiomyopathy, EF 20%, and currently with PCWP of 26 and PAPs\nin the 70s systolic (mean 30s).  The patient was continued on\nher home digoxin, losartan, metoprolol, and aspirin.  We\ndiuresed her with IV Lasix given her elevated PCWP.  She was\nsent home on her regular torsemide and metolazone.\n.\n# Chronic Kidney Disease: Pre-procedure the pt's Cr was 2.5, and\nthe pt received a small amount of contrast in the procedure.\nPatient's B/L Cr is 1.5-2.2. Unclear reason for increase,\nperhaps worsening cardiac function or hypovolemia in setting of\ndecreased PO intake.  The patient's medications were renally\ndosed, and her creatinine was followed, which remained in the\n2.5-2.6 range.  She will follow up with her PCP.\n.\n# HTN: Chronic problem, but pt not currently hypertensive.  The\npatient's losartan and metoprolol were continued.\n.\n# DM: FSBG post procedure was 155.  Patient was put on glargine\ninsulin [**Hospital1 **] and humalog SS QID during the brief hospitalization.\n She resumed her home insulim regimen on discharge.\n.\nTransitional Issues\n# CODE: Confirmed full\n# Health Care Proxy: daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 20774**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 45875**])\n# Contact: [**Name (NI) 892**] (caregiver and significant other) ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 45876**])\n\n# INR: Was subtherapeutic on the day of discharge at 1.7.
