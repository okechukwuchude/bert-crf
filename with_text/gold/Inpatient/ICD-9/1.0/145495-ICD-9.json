On\nthe day prior to presentation ([**2161-5-15**]) he was noted to be tired\nand weak, and he fell. He has not complained of respiratory\nsymtpoms. Overnight at 0100 he dropped to below 90% and placed\non 2LNC. He had respiratory distress, was given nebulizer and\ntylenol without improvement. Later, his O2 sat dropped to 70 on\n2L, and he was switched to NRB with 15L, then 96%. Temp was\n99.6, given albuterol, but respirations increased to 37.

His vitals on transfer - 96 on\n10L, RR 27, and his access was 1 PIV.\n.\nOn the unit, he was tachypneic, but appeared comfortable and\ndenied any symptoms. He had a few episodes of relative\nhypotension to the 80s-90s systolic. His oxygenation improved to\nlow-mid 90s on 5L. His lactate rose to 9.

Also found\nto have VRE bacteremia for which he was started on 14 days of\nLinezolid.\n.\n# Acute respiratory distress/Healthcare Associated Pneumonia:\nPresentation with dyspnea, fever, bandemia, hypoxia, and CXR\nfindings all consistent with acute pneumonia. Given his\nresidence at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, he was started on Vancomycin,\nCefepime, and Levofloxacin. TB felt unlikely given the rapid\nacuity of symptoms and lack of other more subacute\nconstitutional symptoms. Moreover, patient had documented\nadequate treatment of latent TB (with negative CXR) in [**2153**].\nAdditional processes, such as pulmonary embolism, seemed\nunlikely given his therapeutic INR. Patient was treated with\nBipap and appeared to improve, but on hospital day #2, he was\ntachypneic to the 30s, somnolent and working very hard to breath\nso he was intubated and placed on ARDS net ventilation. Once\nstable he was 12L positive and diuresis with IV Lasix was\ninitiated. He responded well to Lasix 20mg IV and was extubated\non [**5-19**] without complication. Diuresis was continued until his\nvolume status was optimized. An echocardiogram showed normal\nsystolic function. He completed a 7 day course of broad\nantibiotics.\n.\n# Severe sepsis: Patient presented with pneumosepsis and\nelevated lactate up to 9.  His lactate trended down to 2 after\n6L IVF in the ED.  His pressures maintained MAP >60 until the\npatient was intubated when he became hypotensive.  A central\nline was placed and he was started on Levophed. He was given\nbolus fluids for CVP <10 and weaned off pressors. He was put on\nVanc/Levo/Cef for presumed HAP. He did have BCx positive for\nGPCs after resolution of sepsis, which were ultimately speciated\nto VRE (Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus). His central venous\ncatheter was removed. He was started on a 14 days course of PO\nLinezolid 600 mg twice daily, which should continue until\n[**2161-6-3**]. Surveillence blood cultures have shown no growth to\ndate. These are still pending and should be followed up on.\n.\n# Delerium: Likely secondary to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy\nfrom infection in a patient with underlying dementia. We\nattempted to minimize unecessary lines and tubes, provide\nfrequent orientation, and avoid aggravating\nmedications/sedatives.\n.\n# Atrial fibrillation: Rate controlled without medications. On\nCoumadin for anticoagulation. His INR was elevated at 3 (likely\nsecondary to antibiotics and poor nutrition), so Coumadin has\nbeen held at discharge. His INR should be monitored and Coumadin\nre-started once necessary.\n.\n# BPH/Urinary Obstruction: Tamsulosin held on admission during\nsevere sepsis, but re-started upon transfer to the floor. The\npatient self-discontinued his foley and had subsequent traumatic\ninjury resulting in blood clots that would cause painful\nobstruction. A foley was placed and will need to remain until he\nis healed and a voiding trial can be attempted. Frequent\nirrigation should be provided to prevent blood clots.\n.\n# [**Last Name (un) **]: Mild, but eGFR of 40 on admission with elevated BUN.\nCreatinine improved from 1.1 to 0.8 after IVF resuscitation in\nthe MICU, but increased after diuresis. 1.2 at discharge, which\nshould be monitored in the future.\n.\n# Suspected COPD: Patient continued on nebulizer treatement.\n.\n# Microcytic Anemia: Remained relatively stable throughout the\nadmission. He required no blood products.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n- warfarin 3 mg daily\n- aspirin 325 mg daily\n- flomax 0.4 mg daily\n- senna 17.2mg PO HS\n- trazodone 12.5mg PO HS\n- albuterol nebs 0.083%\n- tylenol 650mg PO PRN pain\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. aspirin 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n2. tamsulosin 0.4 mg Capsule, Ext Release 24 hr Sig: One (1)\nCapsule, Ext Release 24 hr PO HS (at bedtime).\n3. senna 8.8 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a\nday) as needed for constipation.\n4. docusate sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\n5. acetaminophen 650 mg/20.3 mL Solution Sig: Six [**Age over 90 1230**]y\n(650) mg PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for Pain.\n6. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for\nNebulization Sig: One (1) nebulizer Inhalation Q4H (every 4\nhours) as needed for shortness of breath, wheezing.\n7. linezolid 600 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q12H (every 12\nhours) for 11 days: last day [**2161-6-3**].\n\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExtended Care\n\nFacility:\n[**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - LTC\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nhealth-care associated pneumonia\nbacteremia\ntoxic/metabolic encephalopathy\nurinary obstruction\n.\ndementia\nanemia\natrial fibrillation\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Confused - always.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker\nor cane).\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nDear Mr. [**Known lastname 55195**],\n\nYou were initially admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for\ntreatment of your difficulty breathing, which was likely\nsecondary to a pneumonia.
