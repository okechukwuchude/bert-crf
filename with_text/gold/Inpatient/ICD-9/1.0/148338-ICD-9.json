Striking fecal loading within the colon, without obstruction.\n\n2. A focally dilated loop of small bowel in the mid abdomen\ncontains contrast and fecalized contents. There is also slowed\nmotility, though a stricture or ischemia are not excluded on\nthis study. Note is made on this study of atherosclerotic SMA\ndisease. 3. New hypodense collection anterior to the liver\nmeasures 1.6 cm, and is new compared with 6/[**2116**]. This may be a\nsmall postsurgical fluid collection. This is too small for\nintervention. Follow up MRI or PET CT may be of utility for\nfurther evaluation. 4. Mild ascites and mesenteric edema, which\nmay be reactive to relatively recent surgery. 5. The low rectal\nanastomosis appears intact, without surrounding fluid collection\nto suggest leak.\n\nCT Abd [**2117-1-18**]\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Compared to the prior study, the amount of fecal loading\nwithin the colon has improved. There are focally dilated loops\nof small bowel, likely\nmid-to-distal ileum, which when compared to the prior study,\nappear more\ndilated. 2. Again noted is atherosclerotic calcification of the\nabdominal aorta, focal low-attenuation lesion in the dome of the\nliver, loculated left pleural effusion. 3. Compared to the prior\nstudy, there is increased opacity in the left lower lobe.\nFindings are consistent with an inflammatory or infectious\netiology.  Aspiration should also be considered.\n\nCXR [**2117-1-18**]\nThe NG tube tip is in the proximal stomach and should be\nadvanced. Current\nstudy demonstrates interstitial pulmonary edema, moderate in\nseverity. The\nleft mediastinal shift is unchanged. Loculated left pleural\neffusion has\nslightly increased in the interim. Bibasal opacities might\nreflect areas of infection, although they potentially could\nreflect interstitial edema as well. Evaluation of the patient\nafter diuresis is highly recommended.\n\nKUB [**2117-1-22**]\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Partial small bowel obstruction which is essentially\nunchanged from prior; however, the amount of retained enteric\ncontrast has slightly decreased. 2. Unconventional position of\nan NG tube should be correlated to functioning. No findings to\nsuggest free air.\n\nCXR [**2028-1-23**]\nFINDINGS: Unchanged small loculated effusion on the left with\ndecreasing\nextent of the retrocardiac atelectasis. No pulmonary edema. No\nnewly\nappeared focal parenchymal opacities. Borderline size of the\ncardiac\nsilhouette. Unchanged course of the nasogastric tube.\n\nUExt US [**2117-1-24**]\nIMPRESSION: No DVT in the left upper extremity. Findings were\ndiscussed in\nperson with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 12:15 p.m. on [**2117-1-24**].\n\nCXR [**2117-1-25**]\nFINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the left\npleural effusion has mildly increased. There is increasing\nsubsequent atelectasis in the left retrocardiac lung areas.\nNewly appeared is a right lower lobe opacity, likely\nrepresenting a combination of pneumonia and pulmonary edema.\nUnchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. The\npresence of a small right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.\n\nCXR [**2028-1-26**]\nIMPRESSION: Interval decrease in right basal opacity after\ndiuresis though\nthe residual remains concerning for pneumonia.\n\nVideo Swallow [**2117-1-29**]\nFluoroscopic video oropharyngeal swallow evaluation was\nperformed in\ncollaboration with the speech and swallow therapist. Thin\nbarium, thick\nbarium, and barium-coated cookie were administered. There is\npenetration with thin barium; however, no frank aspiration was\nobserved. For more details, please refer to speech and swallow\ntherapist note in the medical record.\n\nCXR [**2117-1-30**]\nIMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**1-22**] through [**1-27**]:\nLungs are severely hyperinflated. Previous bibasilar\natelectasis, quite\nsevere on the right, has entirely resolved. There is no\npulmonary edema.\nSmall residual bilateral pleural effusions are smaller still.\nHeart size is normal. There is no pneumothorax. A left PIC line\nends in the mid left\nbrachiocephalic vein. Findings are most consistent with severe\nbronchospasm as a cause of respiratory insufficiency. The larynx\nand subglottic trachea are not evaluated by this study.\n\nKUB [**2117-1-31**]\nThere is disproportionate distention of the large bowel with\nrespect to small bowel with abrupt change in caliber in the\nlarge bowel at the proximal sigmoid. Since there is formed stool\nin the rectum, this could be functional, such as a developing\ncolonic ileus. Leftward displacement of the rectum raises the\npossibility of an adjacent pelvic fluid collection, but it does\nnot directly compress the rectum or sigmoid. If there is concern\nfor hematoma or pelvic infection, CT scanning would be required.\nMaximum caliber of the right colon is 9 cm in the cecum and\nthere is preservation of normal haustral architecture and no gas\nin the wall of the colon. There is no pneumoperitoneum.\n\n[**Numeric Identifier 4684**] FLUORO GUID PLCT/REPLCT/REMOVE CENTRAL LINE Study Date of\n[**2117-2-2**] 1:07 PM\nIMPRESSION: Uncomplicated exchange of left-sided venous catheter\nfor a 5\nFrench 38 cm PICC with its tip at the mid SVC, under\nfluoroscopic guidance.  Please see above for details. PICC is\nready for use.\n\nEMG Study Date of [**2117-2-3**]\nClinical Interpretation: Abnormal study. There is\nelectrophysiologic evidence for a chronic neurogenic lesion\ninvolving the left recurrent laryngeal nerve with incomplete\nreinnervation. Evidence for synkinesis is also present. The\nright recurrent laryngeal nerve is normal.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient was admitted to the colorectal surgery service on\n[**2117-1-15**] for a small bowel obstruction and had an exploratory\nlaparotomy with lysis of adhesions on HD 8 after medical\nmanagement failed. There were no complications from the\nprocedure and the patient tolerated the procedure well. Please\nrefer to the operative note for more details on the procedure.\n\nNeuro: During her stay and post-operatively, the patient\nreceived IV morphine as needed along with IV Tylenol, all with\ngood effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral\nintake and clears by speech and swallow to take pills orally,\nthe patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.\n\nCV: The patient was more or less stable from a cardiovascular\nstandpoint; She was intermittently tachycardic on the floor\nprior to surgery and in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after which was successfully\nmanaged with IV Lopressor (please refer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course\nbelow). Occasional hypertension was successfully treated with\nhydralazine. Vital signs were routinely monitored. The patient\nwas transitioned to home dose of Metoprolol and the patient's\nblood pressure was adequately controlled.\n\nPulmonary: The patient had some pulmonary issues during her\nhospital stay. Post operatively, she had some desaturation on RA\n(to the 80's) as well as increasing stridor. A CXR was\nconcerning for possible aspiration vs hospital acquired\npneumonia and she was started on a 10 day course of\nlevofloxacin. ENT was consulted for the apparent upper\nrespiratory obstructive stridor and it was found that her left\nvocal cord was non functional from a previous injury (possibly\nduring the CEA) and the right vocal cord was not functioning\nwell which is what likely contributed to the stridor. The pt was\ntransferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on POD 1 for respiratory precautions in\ncase of deterioration and need for intubation. Antibiotic\ncoverage was broadened on POD 3 to include vancomycin and Zosyn\ndue to a worsening CXR. Racemic epinephrine and Decadron\nimproved her symptoms. She never needed to be intubated and\neventually was satting well on RA. Please refer to the ICU\ncourse below for more details. She was transferred back to the\nfloor on POD4 with markedly improved stridor and dyspnea.\nThereafter, her saturations and vitals remained stable despite\noccasional subjective dyspnea while supine. ENT was following\nthroughout and noted improvement in the right vocal cord.\nAlbuterol and ipratropium nebulizer treatments were given every\n6 hours. All vital signs were routinely monitored. The patient\nwas taken to the [**Hospital **] clinic for LEMG on [**2116-2-4**] which showed left\nvocal fold paralysis and right vocal fold paresis. The ENT\nattending recommended reassessment of motion this week, if no\nchanges would recommend observation given that her symptoms are\nstable. If symptoms worsen or limit her, will consider L. vocal\nfold\nBotox injection vs. temporary suture lateralization. The ENT\nteam was comfortable with diet per speech and swallow and\nprimary teams.\n\nGI/GU: Due to no improvement and in fact worsening obstructive\npicture, the pt ended up having an ex-lap on HD 8. Prior to\nthat, she was only having minimal flatus and bowel movements\nwith aggressive suppository treatments. She was kept NPO the\nwhole time. Post-operatively, the patient was also kept NPO for\na while aggressive awaiting return of bowel function. NGT tube\nwas removed on POD 2 due to very low output. A PICC line was\nplaced on POD 3 and TPN was initiated shortly thereafter. She\nhad bowel sounds throughout this whole time and abdominal\ndistention was improving. On POD 6 she began passing flatus. Due\nto the possible aspiration pneumonia and vocal cord issues, a\nspeech and swallow study was ordered before advancing her diet.\nShe failed this study. The next day, a video swallow study was\nordered which she passed and was allowed to start a diet with\nmany aspiration precautions in place. She was advanced to sips\non POD 7 which was tolerated well with no coughing or gagging.\nHowever, the next day she stopped passing flatus and had some\nabdominal distention and was thus made back to an NPO status.\nHer distention and obstipation continued to worsen and a KUB was\nobtained which showed colonic ileus. The patient was given\nbisacodyl suppositories in the mornings. On [**2116-2-5**] the patient\nwas passing flatus and having bowel movements. Her diet was\nadvanced from clear liquids to full liquids which were tolerated\nwell. On [**2117-2-5**] was advanced to ground mechanical soft diet with\nensure supplements. Because of prolonged NPO status the patient\nwas started on TPN and was followed closely by inpatient\nnutrition. The patient was to be discharged on TPN cycled\novernight with intention of tapering TPN as her PO intake\nincreased. Please see speech and swallow note attached to\ndischarge paperwork. The patient will need continued speech\ntherapy during her rehabilitation hospital stay.\n\nDue to urinary retention in the beginning, a Foley was placed.\nIt was removed on HD 8. It was again replaced on HD 9/POD1 for\nclose urine output monitoring given respiratory status and\ndesire to keep from fluid overload. It was removed on POD 5. She\nhad no urinary issues since and has been making adequate urine\non her own throughout the rest of her stay. Intake and output\nwere closely monitored.\n\nID: refer to the antibiotic regimen mentioned above in the\npulmonary section.\n\nProphylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during\nthis stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as\npossible. The heparin was then administered in the TPN.\n\n[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course:\n#Stridor: patient was scoped by ENT who noted sluggish vocal\ncords and recommended steroids. She received 3 doses of\ndexamethasone, racemic epinephrine nebs and ipratropium nebs\nwith some improvement in symptoms. She was kept on face mask in\nthe ICU and her O2 sat was stable. On repeat scope, she was\nnoted to have paralyzed left vocal cord with interval\nimprovement in right vocal cord. Left vocal cord paralysis\nsuspected to be chronic issue related to past surgeries.  Right\nvocal cord was hyperkinetic, likely stunning related to\nintubation.  Her stridor improved with time.\n\n#Healthcare acquired pneumonia: After patient's stridor\nimproved, she was noted to have continued O2 requirement and\nrepeat CXR showed a new RLL consolidation and she was started on\ntreatment for HCAP with vancomycin and cefepime on [**2117-1-25**].\n\n#Tachycardia: patient intermittently in sinus tachycardia,\nthought to be multifactorial including pain and anxiety. PE\nconsidered given recent surgery, however patient hemodynamically\nstable. Less likely hypovolemia given adequate UOP. Given her\nNPO status, her home metoprolol was converted to IV and\npatient's tachycardia responded well to metoprolol. Her pain was\ncontrolled with IV morphine prn and her anxiety was controlled\nwith Ativan prn.\n\n# Nutrition: As patient was NPO due to stridor and\npost-operative from abdominal surgery, a PICC line was placed\nand TPN was initiated.\n\n\nAt the time of discharge on  [**2116-2-6**] the patient was doing well,\nafebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet,\nambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well\ncontrolled.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\ncaltrate +D, metoprolol 12.5\", mvi, metamucil\", oxycodone\nprn, immodium prn\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. insulin regular human 100 unit/mL Solution Sig: please refer\nto insulin sliding scale order  Injection ASDIR (AS DIRECTED):\nPlease see sliding scale attatched.
