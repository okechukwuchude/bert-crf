Prior to this he had been having coughing\nfit and wife found him slumped on the couch with rhythmic\njerking of hands but did not respond to voice but could squeeze\nhis hands. He had not been having any fevers. Spontaneously\nresolved after several minutes, when EMS arrived pt was\npost-ictal with GCS 3. Intubated for airway protection at\nSouthern [**Hospital **] medical center because he was still unresponsive but\nhad stopped convulsing, got tylenol suppository there. got\ndecadron, keppra, ativan, propofol for sedation. Head CT was\nobtained at OSH which was unchanged from scan [**10-31**] when mass\ninitially discovered. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] ED for continuity\nof care.\n.\nSeen by Neuro in ED, reviewed CT head from OSH. Has not been\ngetting chemo but anemic and thrombocytopenic. His primary\nneuro-oncologist was paged and suggested that LP may be\nnecessary if he appears to be infected clinically. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**]\nwill follow in house instead of neuro consult team. He\nrecommended: Keppra 1g IV BID 1:1 w/ PO as well as decadron 4mg\nQ6hrs. ED was not comfortable w/ doing LP given mass effect\n(though recommended by his neuro-oncologist) and\nthrombocytopenia to 64 (guideline is 80).

ET tube terminates 5 cm from the carina without evidence of\npneumothorax.\n2. There is prominence of hilar and mediastinal silhouette and\npulmonary\nvasculature, which may be reflective of increased pulmonary\nvascular pressure.\n3. Retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis or aspiration;\nhowever,\nsuperimposed infection cannot be entirely excluded.\n\nCXR (PA & LAT) [**2144-1-26**]:\nIMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of\nprior chest\nradiographs:\n\nThe lateral view shows a wedge-shaped area of opacity in one of\nthe lower\nlungs, could be a composite shadow of anterior spinal\nosteophytes and large lower lung vessels. Two other regions of\nabnormality are the suggestion of 11-mm wide right upper lobe\nnodule at the level of the first anterior interspace and\nfullness in the right lower paratracheal mediastinum, which\ncould be adenopathy or fat. All these issues would be resolved\nwith routine chest CT.\n\nHeart is top normal size, there is no pulmonary edema or pleural\neffusion.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n64 yo M w/ renal cell CA to the brain p/w new onset seizure.\n.\n#. S/p seizure: Pt presented with new onset seizure at home.  Pt\nhad mass lesion in brain and had been recently taken off seizure\nprophylaxis.  He had been on a dexamethasone taper and had had\nhis last dose of keppra on [**2144-1-21**]. He initially presented to an\nOSH where he was intubated for airway protection.  Head CT at\nOSH was largely unchanged per neurology team.  Lumbar puncture\nwas not performed as he was afebrile with no leukocytosis and\nbecause he had thrombocytopenia (plts 60s).  Clinical suspicion\nfor infectious etiology for seizure was quite low.  He was\nplaced back on keppra and dexamethasone and extubated on [**2144-1-25**]\nwith no complications.  He did not have further seizures in the\nhospital.  He was discharged with follow-up with his primary\nneuro-oncologist.\n.\n#. Renal cell carcinoma: Pt with renal cell carcinoma metastatic\nto brain.  He was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma in [**6-/2141**]\nand was s/p right nephrectomy [**8-/2141**] with recently diagnosed\nleft frontal brain mass.  He was s/p first cyberknife treatment\n[**2144-1-14**].  Pt had chronic mild right hemiparesis, anomia, and\ndysphasia but no new neurologic deficits.  He had recently\ncompleted keppra course and had been on dexamethasone taper\nprior to presenting with new onset seizure.  He had intermittent\nheadaches controlled with oxycodone.  He will follow up with his\nprimary oncologist as outpatient.\n.\n#. ?Aspiration: CXR on admission showed retrocardiac opacity,\nlikely atelectasis vs. aspiration but could not rule out PNA. Pt\nhad low grade temp 100.2 upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED but was\nafebrile with no leukocytosis throughout remainder of hospital\ncourse. Clinical suspicion for PNA was quite low and he was not\nstarted on antibiotics.  Repeat cxr showed an opacity that was\nread as possible composite shadow of osteophytes and lung\nvessels; two other regions of fullness were interpreted as\nadenopathy or fat.  Pt also reportedly had difficulty swallowing\nat ICU and was put on thickened liquid diet.  He underwent a\nspeech and swallow assessment and was deemed safe for thin\nliquids and regular consistency solids.\n\n#. Normocytic Anemia: Pt with normocytic anemia, Hct 30-35\nduring hospital admission.  Given anemia in conjunction with\nthrombocytopenia, SPEP and UPEP were sent to rule out multiple\nmyeloma.  SPEP showed low levels of IgG but was otherwise\nunremarkable.  Hct remained stable and pt had no evidence of\nbleeding.\n.\n#. CKD: Cr baseline was 1.7.  Cr was 1.3-1.5 during admission.\n\n.\n#. Thrombocytopenia:  Pt presented with thrombocytopenia, plt\ncount in 60s.  He was given 1 unit platelets upon admission to\nICU.  Platelet count had slowly been downtrending since\n[**2143-11-21**].  Peripheral smear was examined per ICU and did not\nshow schistocytes to suggest TTP.  Thrombocytopenia may have\nbeen [**12-25**] dexamethasone.  He was started on folic acid and plt\ncount rose to 108 by time of discharge.\n.\n#. DMII: Pt had been on glyburide at home and was maintained on\nHISS while in the hospital.  He had rare hyperglycemia to 400s\nwhile on dexamethasone which improved by time of discharge.  He\nwas discharged back on home dose of glyburide.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nALLOPURINOL -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 100 mg Tablet -\n1\nTablet(s) by mouth DAILY (Daily)\nDEXAMETHASONE -  (Prescribed by Other Provider; Dose adjustment\n-\nno new Rx) - 2 mg Tablet - 2 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day\nGLYBURIDE -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 5 mg Tablet - 1\nTablet(s) by mouth twice a day\nLEVETIRACETAM [KEPPRA] - 500 mg Tablet - One Tablet(s) by mouth\ntwice a day starting [**2144-1-12**] stopped [**2144-1-21**]\nLISINOPRIL -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - Dosage uncertain\nLORAZEPAM - 0.5 mg Tablet - [**11-24**] Tablet(s) by mouth 30 minutes\nprior to your CyberKnife treatment\nOXYCODONE - 5 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth every six (6)\nhours as needed for pain\nSIMVASTATIN -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 40 mg Tablet - 1\nTablet(s) by mouth DAILY (Daily)\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. simvastatin 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\n2. lisinopril 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n\n3. glyburide 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.\n4. dexamethasone 4 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO qam.\nDisp:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n5. dexamethasone 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime\nfor 3 days: Take in addition to dexamethasone 4mg in the morning\nthrough [**2144-1-29**].\nDisp:*3 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n6.
