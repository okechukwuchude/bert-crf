Please measure colonic\ndiameter.\n\nIMPRESSION: Three views of the abdomen show no appreciable\nchange in the\ndiameter of the widest part of the colon, the ascending, 84 mm\nyesterday and 88 mm today. There is no appreciable wall\nthickening or intramural emphysema to suggest ischemia.\nGeneralized gaseous distention is moderate throughout the GI\ntract except for the stomach which is decompressed by a\nnasogastric tube.\n\nKUB ([**2156-3-8**])\n\n1. Interval improvement in patient's colonic dilatation, with\nscattered\nair-filled loops of small and large bowel without evidence of\nsignificant\ndilatation. Air-fluid levels are identified on the decubitus\nview.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **] yo M, Russian speaking only, with dementia, CKD, BPH\npresented after witnessed mechanical fall at rehab and found to\nhave a comminuted left intertrochanteric femoral fracture\n.\n# Left femur fracture: Ortho was consulted in the ED and\nconsented patient for surgery and placed pin for traction. The\npt presented with Hct 34 (Baseline Hct 35.8 [**2156-1-14**]). He was\ngiven Morpine 2mg IV, Morphine 4mg x 1, NS 2L, Haldol 5mg, and\n1U PRBC. His post transfusion Hct dropped to 29 and he was\ntransfused a second unit without appropriate bump (Hct stayed at\n29). Foley was placed. Given unclear source of bleeding and\nhypotension on arrival, the patient was admitted to MICU for\ncloser monitoring. VS on transfer were 97.3, 100, 136/86, 22,\n100/2L.  Upon admission to MICU, the patient appeared in pain.\nThe patient's BP normalized after 2L. Hypotension was thought\nsecondary to morphine amdinistration in the ED. He was afebrile\nwith negative cardiac enzymes. It was unclear where his source\nof bleeding was but the patient was guaiac negative. His thigh\nhad been firm and it was suspected that he may a hematoma there.\nHe remained hemodynamically stable and was thought appropriate\nfor transfer to medicine. He was transferred to the medicine\nfloor on [**2-29**] and taken for surgery on [**3-1**], where he underwent\nORIF of his left hip. He went to the SICU post-op to recover, as\nhe was transiently hypotensive during the procedure.  His SICU\ncourse included UTI and post op ileus (see below).  On [**2156-3-4**]\nhe was called out to the medicine floor.  He continued to have a\nlarge amount of serous fluid drain from the traction wounds in\nhis knee.  His Hct remained stable in the low 30s. Ortho\nrecommendations were to continue weight beairng as tolerated,\nlovenox for DVT prophylaxis and tylenol for pain.  He should\nfollow up in two weeks in ortho clinic with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **],\nNP.\n\n# Abdominal distension/ileus: In the MICU the patient was found\nto have a mildly distended abdomen that was soft and non tender,\nwith an unclear baseline.  It was noted in the records that the\npatient required agressive bowel regimen at rehab it was thought\nthat he had chronic constipation and was given an aggressive\nbowel regimen. After the patient went to the OR he developed a\npost op ileus confirmed by KUB and had an NGT placed to suction.\n He had a rectal tube placed for decompression but this failed.\nOn PO D# 4 he was started on PPN for nutrition.  GI was\nconsulted and they felt this was a pseudoobstruction.  They\nrecommended continued NG suction, avoiding narcotics and\nanticholinergics, and changing his position every hour.  He\nshould have a daily KUB and if his colon diameter is between\n10-12 cm, surgery should be consulted because this is a surgical\nemergency.  It was 8.8cm on [**2156-3-7**], and unchanged on [**2156-3-8**].\nNGT was taken off suction and patient had low residuals.  NG was\ndiscontinued per general surgery recs on [**2156-3-9**].  Receiving TPN.\n Patient will need speech and swallow evaluation on admission to\nrehab.\n\n# UTI: In the SICU the patient was found to have a proteus uti.\nHis foley was changed and he was started on ceftriaxone on [**3-3**]\nand should complete a 14 day course.\n\n# CKD: The patient presented with Cr of 1.9.  He had an unclear\nbaseline.  His most recent creatinine in OMR was 2.1 on [**8-16**].\nThe rest of his electrolytes were normal.  Urine lytes were\nconsistent with pre-renal azotemia.  Over the course of\nhospitlaization the patient's creatinine improved to 1.2.  It\nwas 0.9 on discharge.\n\n# Dementia with behavioural disturbances: The patient lives in\nthe behavioural unit at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.  He is oriented x 1 a\nbaseline.  Prior to the surgery the patient was functioning\nbelow baseline per family members, taking [**Name2 (NI) 16910**] to recognize\nthem then normal.  After the operation he remained verbally\nunresponsive to family members and would not follow commands.\nHe was not given narcotics for worsening of his mental status.\nThe patient was continued on his home dose Quetiapine 150 mg\n[**Hospital1 **].\n\n# Depression / Anxiety: Unclear severity. The patient was\ncontinued on his Citalopram 40 mg po daily.\n\n# Elevated troponin: The patient was initially found to have an\nelevated troponin compared to his baseline, however it did not\ntrend up and repeat EKG showed no changes so it was not thought\nto be from ACS.\n\n# BPH: The patient had a foley placed,  His terazosin was\ninitially held in the ICU given concern for hypotension.\n\n# Code Status: DNR/DNI (this was reversed temporarily for the\noperation then DNR/DNI again)\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMorphine 4mg po Q4H PRN\nAcetaminophen 650 mg Q4H PRN\nMilk of Magnesia 30 mL po daily\nCitalopram 40 mg po daily\nMiralax 17gm po daily\nTerazosin 2 mg po QPM\nQuetiapine 150 mg po BID\nLorazepam 0.5 mg po BID PRN\nEucerin 1 application daily\nFerrous sulfate 325 mg po daily\nCyanocobalamin 1000 mcg daily\nSodium Fluoride 10 mL QHS Swish\nBisacodyl suppository 10 mg daily\nSenna 2 tabs [**Hospital1 **]\nMirtazapine 15 mg QHS\nOmeprazole 20 mg daily\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
