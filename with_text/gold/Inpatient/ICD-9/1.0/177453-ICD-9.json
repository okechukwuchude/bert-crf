No spontaneous\necho contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left\natrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right\natrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen\nby 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are\nnormal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly\ndepressed globally(LVEF= 45 %). The right ventricle displays\nborderline normal free wall function. There are simple atheroma\nin the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic\narch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending\nthoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly\nthickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic\nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The\nregurgitation is mostly central but has a slight posterior lean.\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results in the\noperating room at the time of the study.\n\nPOST BYPASS The patient is AV paced. There is normal\nbiventricular systolic function with a left ventricular ejection\nfraction of 55-60%. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is in situ.\nIt appears well seated. There is trace mitral regurgitation.\nThere is no mitral stenosis. The remainder of valvular function\nremains unchanged. The thoracic aorta appears intact after\ndecannulation.\n  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance\nwith HCFA regulations.\n\nElectronically signed by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4901**], MD, Interpreting physician\n[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2165-1-16**] 16:12\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nAdmitted [**1-16**] and underwent surgery with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
