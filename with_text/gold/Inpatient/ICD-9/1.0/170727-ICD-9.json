As per Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 26216**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]\nresident physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient had transverse colitis diagnosed\non outside hospital CT four days ago. Given this history these\nnodes may relate to underlying infectious or inflammatory\netiology. Recommend clinical correlation and GI\nfollow-up/evaluation. If no evidence of Crohn's\ndisease/inflammatory bowel disease, suggest repeat CT in [**4-8**]\nmonths to assess for interval change of the lymph nodes.\n\nColonoscopy Impression [**2186-8-2**]:Stool in the transverse colon,\nascending colon and cecum;;Erythema and congestion in the\ncolon;v Normal mucosa in the colon; Otherwise normal colonoscopy\nto terminal ileum\n\nEndoscopy Impression [**2186-8-2**]: Erythema, congestion and erosion\nin the antrum; Coffee-ground blood in the stomach;Ulcer in the\npylorus (biopsy)\nOtherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum\n\nBiopsies: SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: GI BX ( 3 JARS) [**2186-8-2**]\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\n\nA.  Gastric ulcer biopsy:  Focal chronic active gastritis with\nerosion and a cluster of macrophages suggestive of poorly formed\ngranuloma.  Special stain for H. pylori pending.\nB.  Terminal ileum:  Focal active ileitis.\nC.  Sigmoid biopsies:  Focal chronic active colitis.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n28 yo F with a past medical history of IBS, ADD presents with\nabdominal pain and msk pain. Her symptoms initially started with\ndiarrhea and developed into abdominal pain and polymyalgias.\n.\n#. Abdominal pain: In a patient who was completely healthy with\nthe exception of IBS, the differential of this pain was\nextensive upon admission. A variety of tests were performed. She\nhad a normal HCG and normal pelvic exam. GC and Chlmydia labs\nwere negative. She had a normal abdomen CT with normal lipase\nand amylase. Lactate was normal x2 and she was guaiac negative.\nShe was initially treated with Cipro/Flagyl, but this was\nstopped when C.diff, O+P, and all other infectious stool studies\nwere negative and IBD became presumed diagnosis. Crohns seemed\nmost likely diagnosis, given family history of two first cousins\nwith several weeks of abdominal pain with myalgia/arthralgia and\nrash (see below.) Patient was treated empirically with IV\nSolumedrol because she was in severe pain and had a nodular\nrash. She then underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy and endoscopy.\nFlex sig showed erythema and congestion in the colon, Normal\nmucosa in the colon and otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal\nileum. Upper endoscopy showed erythema, congestion and erosion\nin the antrum,Coffee-ground blood in the stomach,Ulcer in the\npylorus (biopsy),Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the\nduodenum. Biopsies showed Focal chronic active gastritis with\nerosion and a cluster of macrophages suggestive of poorly formed\ngranuloma with H.pylori stain pending, focal active ileitis and\nfocal chronic active colitis. Patient was changed from IV\nSolumedrol to PO prednisone for discharge and started on\nprotonix and mesalamine 2g [**Hospital1 **]. She will followup at [**Hospital1 41724**] in\n[**Location (un) 7349**].\n.\n# Arthrlagias/Myalgias: Patient presented with arthralgias and\nmyalgias which worsened over first night of hospitalization. She\nwas treated with IV Dilaudid. She also developed a erythematous,\nnodular rash on her legs and arms over the first night of her\nadmission; this rash started on her ankles and rapidly spread\nover the course of 10 hours to her arms. This rash resolved on\nits own, without treatment, in the following 10 hours. This rash\nwas thought to be consistent with erythema nodosum, although the\ntime course was puzzling. The arthralgias and myalgias were also\nthought to be extra-intestinal manifestations of IBD. CK 41, ESR\n110.\n.\n# Hypotension: Patient was admitted to the ICU initially because\nshe was thought to be hypotensive with SBPs in 70s and 80s.\nPatient given at least 6 L IVF in the ED/ICU and remained with\nBP in the 90s. She was completely asymptomatic for hypotension\nand otherwise hemodynamically stable. Patient continued to have\nsystolic blood pressures in 80s throughout hospitalization\nwithout symptoms.\n.\n# Anemia: Patient's baseline HCT is unknown. Admission HCT was\n33.7, lowest HCT was 24.7, discharge 27. Given endoscopy showing\nulcer and colonoscopy showing melena, the patient likely bled\nfrom her ulcer at some point. These studies indicate that there\nis now no active bleeding and patient is competely\nhemodynamically stable. Of note, iron, ferritin and TIBC were\nall low, TSH was normal. There is likely a component of both\niron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease. We will not treat\nwith iron given GI symptoms.  This should be followed up with\nthe patient's PCP.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\n# Adderall 10 mg po BID - TID\n# Loestrin daily\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. Loestrin 1.5/30 (21) 1.5-30 mg-mcg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet\nPO daily (): Take according to previous prescription.\n2. Prednisone 20 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n3. Hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO Q4H (every 4\nhours) as needed for pain.\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n4. Pantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.) Sig: One\n(1) Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.) PO Q12H (every 12 hours).\nDisp:*60 Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)(s)* Refills:*2*\n5. Mesalamine 500 mg Capsule, Sustained Release Sig: Four (4)\nCapsule, Sustained Release PO BID (2 times a day).\nDisp:*240 Capsule, Sustained Release(s)* Refills:*2*\n6. Ativan 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every 6-8 hours\nas needed for pain.\nDisp:*40 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nHome\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nColitis secondary to Inflammatory Bowel Disase- Crohns\nHypotension\nAnemia\nDuodenal Ulcer\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nYou were admitted to the hospital for severe abdominal pain and\nmusculoskeletal pain with a rash. You were initially sent to the\nICU because your blood pressure was low. There you were given IV\nfluids. Your blood pressure increased slightly and you remained\nstable and so it was determined that your blood pressure is\nlikely low at baseline. After leaving the ICU, your rash\nworsened on your first night but resolved spontaneously. You\nwere treated with pain medications, started on antibiotics for\nconcern for possible infection and started on steroids out of\nconcern for IBD. You had a flexible sigmoidoscopy that showed\ninflammation in your colon and you had an endoscopy which showed\nan ulcer. The studies did not see any active bleeding but did\nreveal stool with blood (melena) which indicates that you did\nbleed at some point, likely from your ulcer. The GI team found\nthat these studies were likely consistent with Crohns disease\n(Inflammatory Bowel Disease) and the biopsies that they took\nconfirmed this. Of note, your musculoskeletal pain and rash are\nalso consistent with Crohns disease.\n.\nOf note, your hematocrit (blood levels) were low while you were\nhere. This was likely due partially to past bleeding from your\nulcer and partially due to receiving a lot of fluids. This could\nalso partially be due to iron deficiency, as your iron was low.\nWe suggest that your PCP follow up your iron levels at a later\npoint. We continued to follow your hematocrit here and it\nremained stable upon discharge.\n.\nWe will send you home with the following new medications to\ntreated  Crohns disease:\n1. Mesalamine 2 g twice daily\n2. Prednisone 40 mg daily\n3. Protonix 40 mg twice daily\n4. Dilaudid 1 mg as need, max every 4 hours.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nYou should plan to followup with IBD doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital1 1872**] in [**Location (un) 7349**]\nas discussed. You should also followup with your primary care\ndoctor.\n\n\n                             [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] MD [**MD Number(2) 2285**]\n\n"
