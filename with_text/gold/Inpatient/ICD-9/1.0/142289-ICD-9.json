He was diagnosed with lung cancer in\n[**2145-8-31**] now follows with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 16212**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital 8**]\nHospital. In [**Month (only) 359**] he developed acute cord compression and had\ndecompression on [**2145-10-15**]. Discharged to rehab. He was\nreadmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 56568**] for shortness of breath\nwith new finding of large right sided pleural effusion and a RUL\npost obstructive pneumonia; mass abutting RUL bronchus and PA.\nDuring last admission he underwent thoracentesis and, later,\npleurex catheter placement on [**11-17**]. Pleural fluid positive for\nmalignant cells, AFB smear negative. Also initiated palliative\nXRT to RUL. IP did not feel mass was amenable to stenting. Notes\nin discharge summary state that patient was DNR/DNI at\ndischarge.\n\nPatient was discharged to [**Hospital 392**] Rehab. At rehab this morning it\nwas discovered that there were not appropriate supplies to drain\npleurex. Had his usual session XRT this AM. He also had CXR\nwhich was read as complete R sided opacification. When arrived\nback at rehab, he was sent to the ED due to inability to drain\nthe effusion.\n\nIn the ED, initial vs were: T96.8 70 146/88 22 96% on 15L O2.\nHRs have since been in the 130s - not clear if HR 70 truly\naccurate. Has been tachypneic to 30s. CXR performed with finding\nof interval increase in pleural effusion and R lung base\nopacificition. IP saw patient and drained 550 cc fluid from\npatient's pleurex catheter. A bedside ultrasound was obtained\nshowing no pericardial effusion. Patient was given vancomycin\nand zosyn. Attempts were made to contact interpreter but this\nwas not possible - could not confirm DNR status and seemed to\nsuggest that patient was full code.\n\nIn the MICU, patient interviewed with an interpreter.

The\nestimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular\nwall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild\nglobal left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 %). Systolic\nfunction of apical segments is relatively preserved suggesting a\nnon-ischemic etiology. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic\nstenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral\nregurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic\nhypertension. There is a trivial anterior pericardial effusion.\nIMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild global\nhypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc.). Mild\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension.\n\n[**2145-11-20**] Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound:\nPeroneal veins not visualized. No evidence of deep venous\nthrombosis.\n\n[**2145-11-21**] Chest Xray\nThere is essentially no change in chest findings with right\nupper lobe\ncomplete opacification, right pleural effusion, ground-glass\nopacity and\nmass-like consolidation in the right lower lobe, nodular opacity\nprojecting in the left upper lobe and peribronchial\nabnormalities in the left lower lobe or due to patient's known\nnon-small cell lung cancer. There are no new lung abnormalities.\nCardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Right apical chest\ntube remains in place. Spinal hardware is present. There is no\npneumothorax.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n77 year old male with metastatic lung cancer and malignant\npleural effusion admitted for pleural catheter drainage.\n\n# Pleurex catheter drainage: He initially presented to the\nemergency room after a radiation oncology appointment and\ninability to drain pleurex at rehab facility.  Per son, this was\nlikely due to not accessing pleurex catheter appropriately.  In\ntotal, patient has had approximately 2500 cc of fluid removed\nduring his stay.  He was initially admitted overnight to the\nMICU after experiencing shortness of breath, tachypnea and\nhypoxia in the emergency room; however, this quickly resolved.\n\n# Shortness of Breath: He has baseline shortness of breath due\nto persistent malignant effusion and post-obstructive pneumonia\nsecondary to mass.  Resolved with drainage of pleurex catheter.\nThis should be drained daily after discharge.  Information\nprovided to nursing director at [**Hospital 392**] rehab by interventional\npulmonary service and video is sent with patient.  Please call\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 3020**] if any questions or concerns regarding drainage.\n\n# Pneumonia/Hypoxia: Patient completed a course for\npost-obstructive pneumonia and other than leukocytosis as below\nhas no other signs or symptoms of infection.  Has been C. diff\nnegative during this admission.  UA negative, CXR without new\nfindings, C. diff negative as above, blood cultures are no\ngrowth to date and patient ruled out for flu, parainfluenza,\nadenovirus and RSV.  Tachypnea and hypoxia improved as above\nwith drainage of pleurex.   LENIs negative as well making PE\nless likely.  He was given a few doses of vancomycin and\ncefepime while in the intensive care unit, but these were\ndiscontinued upon transfer to the floor.\n\n# Stage IV NSCL and Malignant effusion: Known mets to spine and\nmalignant effusion. Already undergoing palliative xrt, last dose\ntoday. Too debilitated for chemo at this time.  We continued\npain control as per prior to admission.  Follow up scheduled\nwith oncology service as per discharge paperwork.\n\n# Leukocytosis: C. diff negative, CXR unchanged other than\neffusion, UA negative and blood cultures no growth to date.\nPatient remained afebrile and non-toxic appearing, though\nchronically ill.  [**Month (only) 116**] be secondary to malignancy.\n\n# Tachycardia: Sinus tach vs MAT.  No clear Afib history and he\nwas intermittently irregular making MAT more likely (though\ndifficult to appreciate p waves when accelerated rhyhtm).  Rate\ncontrolled with metoprolol which was increased to 37.5 mg three\ntimes daily.\n\n# Prophylaxis: Continued on fondaparinux, ppi\n\n# Code status: DNR/I\n\n# Communication: Liping (daughter) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 84933**], [**Name (NI) **] (son)\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 84934**]\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\n- Morphine SR 15 mg Q12H\n- Acetaminophen 325 mg Q6H as needed for pain, fever.\n- roxanol 0.25 ml Q3H prn pain\n- Omeprazole 40 mg DAILY\n- Guaifenesin 100 mg/5 mL: 5-10 MLs PO Q6H as needed for cough.\n\n- Benzonatate 100 mg TID\n- Megestrol 400 mg/10 mL : Twenty (20) ml PO once a day.\n- Fondaparinux 2.5 mg Subcutaneous once a day.\n- Albuterol Sulfate [**1-1**] nebs Q4H prn shortness of breath or\nwheeze.\n- Catheter Drainage Please drain IP catheter three times/wk\n- Docusate Sodium 100 mg twice a day.\n- Senna 8.6 mgTwo (2) Tablet PO twice a day\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
