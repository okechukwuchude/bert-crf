This seemed to be related to his chronic right foot\ndrop.  There was no LOC. He immediately ambulated. His family\nnoticed an altered mental status; however, he did not seek\nmedical attention until [**2103-8-2**] when he was found to have\nbilateral SDH's on CT and MR [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. He went on vacation for\na week, had increased headaches and returned to OSH for CT/MR of\nthe head which revealed no significant SDH change, but\nevacuation was required and performed on [**9-17**] with placement of\nbilateral subdural drains.\n\nPer the outside records, he had postop abdominal pain relieved\nin decubitus position. He became confused, diaphoretic,\nhypertensive was intubated and sedated in the early am of POD\n#1. Head CT showed increase in R subdural collection no change\nin the left. Abdominal CT showed 18mm infrarenal abdominal\naortic dissection. He had SBPs in 200s, became bradycardic to\n50s despite IV hydralazine. He was then transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**].\n\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nHypertension (usually runs 140/80 per pt and family)\nEF of 50% ([**2103**])\nLeft BBB\nNephrolithiasis\nOsteoarthritis\nBPH Chronic LBP\nPSH:\nB/l carotid endarterectomy (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8521**], [**First Name3 (LF) **])\ncataract surgery\nutereral stone removal/cystoscopy\n\n\nSocial History:\nlives alone and is independent, mobile, Tobacco: 50+ pack year\nhx (quit 20 years ago), EtOH: family endorses at least\n6oz/scotch/day, no known illicits\n\nFamily History:\nNC\n\nPhysical Exam:\nOn Admission:\nThe patient was intubated.\nT:97  BP:140/52  HR: 66   R 7      O2Sats: 97%\nGen: intubated\nHEENT: atraumatic, normocephalic\nPupils: 2-1.5mm bilaterally\n\nNeuro:\nPatient is intubated\nEO to noxious stimuli\nfollows simple commands on R UE (shows thumbs up)\nwiggles toes bilaterally\nw/d LUE to noxious\nBilateral subdural drains in place\nL drain 100cc since admission\nR drain minimal out put since admission\n\n\nPertinent Results:\n[**2103-9-18**] 01:29PM   PT-13.1 PTT-26.5 INR(PT)-1.1\n[**2103-9-18**] 01:29PM   PLT COUNT-151\n[**2103-9-18**] 01:29PM   NEUTS-92.5* LYMPHS-3.9* MONOS-3.1 EOS-0.4\nBASOS-0.1\n[**2103-9-18**] 01:29PM   WBC-14.8* RBC-4.17* HGB-14.1 HCT-38.7* MCV-93\nMCH-33.9* MCHC-36.5* RDW-13.9\n[**2103-9-18**] 01:29PM   CALCIUM-8.4 PHOSPHATE-2.9 MAGNESIUM-1.7\n[**2103-9-18**] 01:29PM   CK-MB-3 cTropnT-<0.01\n[**2103-9-18**] 01:29PM   CK(CPK)-21*\n[**2103-9-18**] 01:29PM   estGFR-Using this\n[**2103-9-18**] 01:29PM   GLUCOSE-175* UREA N-18 CREAT-0.4* SODIUM-140\nPOTASSIUM-4.1 CHLORIDE-107 TOTAL CO2-24 ANION GAP-13\n\nECHO [**2103-9-18**]\nThe left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by\n2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is at\nleast 15 mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular\nhypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There\nis probably mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50\n%) (the degree of bradycardia and conduction delay associated LV\ndysynchrony make an accurate estimate of LVEF more difficult).\nNo masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue\nDoppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling\npressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.\nRight ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.\nThe diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels\nare normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened\nbut aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is\nseen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is\nno mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is\nseen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There\nis mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nCXR [**2103-9-18**]\n1. Progression of left perihilar and lower hemithorax opacities\nmay represent aspiration or consolidation.\n2. Esophageal catheter with side port in the distal esophagus\nand would need to be advanced 7 cm to ensure most proximal side\nport within the stomach.\n\nCT head [**2103-9-19**]\n1. Marked reduction in size of a right subdural hematoma, with a\ndrain in\nplace, and some residual blood products, layering dependently.\n2. Bifrontal pneumocephalus, increased on the left, following\nremoval of this drain.\n3. No new focus of hemorrhage.\n4. Partial sinus opacification, particular of the sphenoid air\ncells, which may relate to intubation and supine positioning.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname 46825**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] TSICU. On arrival,\nintubated, he was sedated with bradycardia to the 30s requiring\nx1 atropine with good response. A right axillary arterial line\nplaced. Neurosurgery evaluated the patient and removed the L JP\ndrain. The right drain was less functional and was milked with\nimproved output.\n\nA chest X-rays showed progression of left perihilar and lower\nhemithorax opacities may represent aspiration or consolidation.\nAn ECHO was done showed\nEF 50% (the degree of bradycardia and conduction delay\nassociated LV dysynchrony make an accurate estimate of LVEF more\ndifficult).\n\nHe was on a nitro drip at 1mcg/kg/min with SBP goal < 140. EPS\nwas consulted.\nThey agreed with the plan for Hydralazine PRN for BP control\nand approved restarting home dose of lisinopril and amlodipine\nwhen tolerating po's.  He was extubated overnight.\n\nVascular surgery consulted and they felt that this abdominal\npain at OSH was likely not due to his 18mm dissection. There are\nno plan for intervention at this point.\nHe was trasnfered to the Neurosurgery service under the care of\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**]. He was getting Dilantin 100mg TID with 1000mg\ninitial load.  CT head on [**9-19**] showed improvement in right SDH\nbut the drain was left in place for further evacuation in the am\nand this was removed in the pm. Orders for trasnfer to SDU were\nwritten.\n\nCT head in the am of [**2103-9-20**] showed...He had expiratory whezzing\nand nebulizer treatment was started. SQH was started for DVT\nprophylaxis. Foley cathter was discontinued. PT was consulted.\nThey recommended rehab.  Now DOD he is set for d/c to rehab and\nwill f/u accordingly.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nLisinopril 20mg qd\nsertraline 50mg qd\natenolol 25 mg qd\ndoxazosin 4 mg qd\ndiclofenac 25 mg qd\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\nDisp:*60 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*\n2. famotidine 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a\nday).\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n3. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every\n6 hours) as needed for pain/fever: max 4g/24 hrs.\n4. hydralazine 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6\nhours): hold sbp<100.\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n5. oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4\nhours) as needed for pain.\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n6. phenytoin sodium extended 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule\nPO TID (3 times a day).\nDisp:*90 Capsule(s)* Refills:*2*\n7. sertraline 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.\n8. doxazosin 4 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.\n9. metoprolol tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\n10. amlodipine 5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n\n11. lisinopril 20 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\n\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExtended Care\n\nFacility:\n[**Location (un) 931**] House Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Location (un) 932**]\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nBilateral SDH\nBrain Compression\nAAA\nBradycardia\nHypertension\nCOPD\nBack pain\nPVC\nVentricular Tachycardia\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker\nor cane).\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nGeneral Instructions\n\n??????\tHave a friend/family member check your incision daily for\nsigns of infection.\n??????\tTake your pain medicine as prescribed.\n??????\tExercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining,\nor excessive bending.\n??????\tYou may wash your hair only after sutures and/or staples have\nbeen removed.\n??????\tYou may shower before this time using a shower cap to cover\nyour head.\n??????\tIncrease your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain\nmedicine can cause constipation.
