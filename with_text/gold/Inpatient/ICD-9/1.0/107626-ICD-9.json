The patient\nreports that throughtout his life he would have episodes of\nswelling during viral or other illness.  These would include\nswelling of the lip, throat, hand, arm or leg.  He was able to\ntake benadryl and his symptoms would resolved.  He has never\nbeen hospitalized or intubated for these episodes.\nInterestingly, the patients twin brother also has similar\nsymptoms.  The patient was in his usual state of health when he\nwent for an outpatient endoscopy to follow-up prior ulcers.  He\nstates that after the procedure he noticed his eyes swelling and\non the car ride home he could feel his neck and throat swelling.\n They presented to the [**Location (un) 620**] ED in respiratory distress and\nwas having difficulty handling his secreations.  He was given\n125mg solumedrol, 50mg benadryl, pepcid 20mg, and epi-pen x2.\nHe was also evaluated by ENT who saw significant laryngeal\nedema.  His symptoms improved after the 2 epi-pens, but was\ntransferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.\n.\nIn the ED, 96.8 159/107 95 20 94% 2L.

Laryngeal Edema: The patient with a history of prior episodes\nof swelling which typically occur in setting of viral illness.\n[**Name (NI) **] brother also with similar episodes raising the\npossibility to of an hereditary angioedema.  This last episode,\nincurred after endoscopy, has been the most severe and caused\nsignificant laryngeal edema and airway compromise. It is likely\nthat the endoscopy caused irritation that lead to the edema\nthough it has been reported that oral-pharyngeal\ntrauma/manipulation can precipitate episodes of hereditay\nangioedema, such as C1 esterase inhibitor. Also question if\nrecent medication, such as Augmentin, may have spurred allergic\nreaction. Patient received a total of epi-pen x2, IV\nmethylprednisone 125mg x2, benadryl x3, famotidine with\nimprovement in breathing and near complete resolution of\nswelling.  Patient discharged on 5 day prednisone taper as well\nas Pepcid [**Hospital1 **] for 5 days for further treatment of edema as well\nas instruction to discontinue Augmentin. Prescribed epi-pen x2\nin case of emergency. C1 inhibitor level, complement levels,\nESR, CRP as well as tryptase levels were drawn. ESR mildly\nelevated, CRP wnl. Remaining labs pending at time of discharge.\nPatient will follow-up with PCP and from there be referred to an\nallergist for further work-up of what appears to be recurrent\nangioedema.\n.\n# Transaminitis. On admission ALT/AST found to be mildly\nelevated at ; unknown baseline. Patient without h/o liver\ndisease of heavy EtOH use. Patient has been on current statin\ntherapy at current dose for years. Patient does endorse recent\nURI therefore strong possibility mild abnl is secondary to viral\nillness.\nWill follow as outpatient.\n\n#. Hyperlipidemia: Continued home statin\n.\n#. Dispo: Patient discharged to from from the ICU after near\ncomplete resolution of symptoms. He will plan to follow-up with\nPCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 1 week.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMVI\nPrilosec\nPravastatin\nASA 81\nMVI\nCalcium supplementation\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. famotidine 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a\nday).\nDisp:*10 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n2. pravastatin 20 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO daily ().\n3. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable\nPO DAILY (Daily).\n4. epinephrine 0.3 mg/0.3 mL Pen Injector Sig: One (1) ML\nIntramuscular PRN (as needed) as needed for angiedema.\nDisp:*2 ML(s)* Refills:*0*\n5.

You received\nIV steroids as well as benadryl and pepcid. You facial swelling\nlessened, your breathing and swallowing improved. Tests were\nsent off to determine a cause of your recurrent swelling. These\nwere pending at time of discharge. It will be important to\nfollow-up these results with both your primary care physician as\nwell as an allergist.\n.\nCHANGES TO YOUR MEDICATIONS\n- Stop taking Augmentin as it is unclear if this medication\ncontributed to your episode of swelling\nTo treat your swelling start taking:\n- Prednisone - this medication will be administered on a taper\nfor 5 days: 60mg day one, 50mg day 2, 40mg day 3, 30mg day 4,\n20mg day 5\n- Pepcid 20mg twice daily for 5 days.\n- Epi-pen prescription to be used as needed\n.\nAgain it was a pleasure taking care of you.
