Left\nventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global\nsystolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no\nventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is\nmildly dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The\naortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good\nleaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve\nappears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.\nThere is no mitral valve prolapse. There is no pericardial\neffusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Mildly dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. This\nmay be due to right ventricular contusion. Normal left\nventricular systolic function. No LVOT obstruction or\nsignificant valvular lesion seen.\n\n[**2152-10-28**]\nIMPRESSION: No DVT in both lower extremities.\n\n[**2152-10-28**] TIB/FIB XRAY\n1. Right grade 3 open tibia shaft fracture, status post\nfour-compartment\nfasciotomy.\n2. Right closed femoral shaft fracture.\n3. Left lateral leg wound\n4. Complex fascial laceration. Information from the patient's\nchart\nindicates that he has a full thickness laceration to the lower\nlip near the\nmidline through the mucosa and skin, and there is concern for\nfacial fractures\ngiven mechanism of injury.\n\nCOMPARISON: None.\n\nTECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the\nparanasal\nsinuses, facial bones, and mandible. Coronal reformatted images\nwere\nprepared.\n\n\n[**2152-10-29**]\nFINDINGS: No definite facial fractures identified. There is\nmucosal\nthickening and aerated debris within ethmoid sinuses\nbilaterally, and mucosal\nthickening of the maxillary sinuses, left greater than right,\nwith small\nair-fluid levels in the maxillary sinuses. However, no\nunderlying facial\nfracture is identified. There are also air-fluid levels within\nthe sphenoid\nsinus.\n\nThere is absence of the left ninth left upper frontal teeth (9,\n10, and 11)\n(central and lateral incisors). The nasal septum is deviated\nslightly toward\nthe left. There is also slight mucosal thickening of the frontal\nsinuses\nbilaterally.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No fracture identified.\n2. Absence of the left central and lateral incisors. Please\ncorrelate\nclinically to determine whether this is acute.\n3. Mucosal thickening of all sinuses, with small air-fluid\nlevels in the\nmaxillary and sphenoid sinuses. However, no underlying fracture\nis\nidentified. This was discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3827**] on\n[**2152-10-30**] at\n11:45 a.m.\n\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nHe was admitted to the Trauma service. Because he was in shock\nupon arrival he was taken immediately to the operating room for\nan exploratory laparotomy which was negative. Orthopedics was\nconsulted because of his extremity fractures; he was taken to\nthe operating room on [**10-25**] for irrigation and debridement down\nto and inclusive of bone open tibia shaft fracture on right;\nfasciotomies right leg; placement of external fixator across\ntibia placement of the external fixator across femur, right;\nclosed reduction with traction of tibia fracture; closed\nreduction with traction of right femur. There were no\nintraoperative complications. He was taken back to the operating\nroom by Orthopedics on [**10-26**] for removal of external fixation,\nright tibia; irrigation and debridement open fracture, right\ntibia down to and including the bone; intermedullary nailing of\nright tibia with Synthes pin\n#10 X 345 mm nail; removal of external fixator, right femur;\nintramedullary nail fixation with Gamma nail #11 x 125 x400 mm,\n90 mm lag screw. On [**10-30**] he was again taken back to the\noperating room for closure right lower extremity fasciotomies\nboth\nmedially and laterally.\n\nBecause of his multiple facial injuries there was concern for\nfractures. Plastic Surgery was consulted who initially requested\nCT scan of the face but because of hemodynamic instability the\nfacial CT was deferred until [**10-29**]. No fractures were identified.\nHis extensive lip laceration was irrigated and sutured.\n\nPostoperatively he was taken to the Trauma ICU where he remained\nsedated and vented. His tachycardia persisted. He underwent an\nECHO which revealed EF >55% with mildly dilated and hypokinetic\nright ventricle which was likely due to right ventricular\ncontusion. Normal left ventricular systolic function. No LVOT\nobstruction or significant valvular lesion was seen. Cardiology\nwas consulted and recommended continued beta blockade.\n\nHe was eventually weaned and extubated and would later be\ntransferred to the regular nursing unit. His tachycardia\npersisted requiring several trigger events. Cardiology involved\nthe EPS service who recommended to continue with the Lopressor\nand recommended adding Flecainide. The tachycardia did improve\nwith this regimen. He will require outpatient follow up with [**Hospital **]\nclinic for further studies.\n\nHis Heparin was changed to Lovenox for which he will continue\npost discharge until discontinued by Orthopedics in follow up.\n\nSocial work was closely involved with patient and his family\nthroughout his entire hospital stay.\n\nPhysical and Occupational therapy were consulted and worked with\nhim regularly to prepare him for home as there was no insurance\nin place and so rehab placement was not a feasible option. He\nmade significant gains and was eventually cleared for safe\ndischarge to home with his parents.\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
