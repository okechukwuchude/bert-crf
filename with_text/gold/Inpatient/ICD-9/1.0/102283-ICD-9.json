Right upper lobe ground-glass parenchymal opacity, suggestive\nof\npneumonia. Multifocal coalescent ground-glass nodules,\npredominating upper\nlobes but also present in left lower lobe, raise question of\nmetastatic\ninvolvement. Moderate right pleural effusion.\n\n2. Massive conglomerate aortocaval mass with central areas of\nnecrosis, which compresses the IVC, right common and external\niliac veins, and likely also right proximal ureter. Extensive\nmediastinal, hilar, mesenteric, retroperitoneal, and iliac\nlymphadenopathy and massive splenomegaly. Overall picture\nsuggestive of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease.\n\n3. Mildly prominent common bile duct. Please correlate with\nliver function\ntest.\n\n4. Diffuse gallbladder mural edema, likely related to systemic\ndisease,\nunlikely due to cholecystitis.\n\n5. Multiple left renal lesions are incompletely evaluated,\nincluding a 12-mm interpolar left renal lesion (3, 301), which\ncould be further characterized by ultrasound.\n\n[**11-15**] CT Head- 1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass\neffect. 2. Although there is no CT evidence of large\nintracranial mass, MRI with gadolinium is superior in evaluation\nof such lesions and can be considered if not contraindicated.\n\n[**11-15**] LENI- No evidence of right lower extremity deep venous\nthrombosis.\n\n[**11-15**] EKG: ST at 108 bpm, no other acute changes\n\n[**11-18**] Trans thoracic Echo- The left atrium is normal in size. No\natrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The\nestimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular\nwall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic\nfunction are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal\ndefect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are\nnormal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.\nThe aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no\nvalvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is\nlikely related to high cardiac output. Mild (1+) aortic\nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral\nregurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is\nnormal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.\n\n[**11-25**] Renal U/S: 1. No evidence of hydronephrosis, with\nresolution of the mild hydronephrosis seen on CT [**2137-11-15**]. 2.\nNonvisualization of left renal interpolar region indeterminate\nlesion seen on CT scan [**2137-11-15**], due to limited visualization.\nFor further evaluation,if clinically relevant, an MR could be\nperformed.\n\n[**12-3**] CXR: The heart size remains normal and no typical\nconfigurational abnormalities is seen. Thoracic aorta, stable\nand within normal limits. Position of previously described left\nsubclavian approach advanced central venous catheter remains\nunchanged terminating overlying the SVC at the level of the\ncarina.  No pneumothorax is seen. In comparison with the next\npreceding portable examination, the findings have cleared up\nmarkedly. In particular the basal bilateral densities strongly\nsuggestive of bilateral pleural effusions as seen on [**2137-11-21**], have now practically cleared completely, as both lateral\nand posterior pleural sinuses are free with the patient in\nupright position. Also, the parenchymal densities have\nregressed; however, significant residuals remain on both sides.\nThese consist of lateral located hazy parenchymal densities\nclose to the pleural space at the level of the third and fourth\nrib. On the left side these parenchymal densities are also in\nperipheral location but somewhat higher up and overlying the\nsecond and third ribs including the corresponding interspace. In\ncomparison with the preceding single view examination, it is\npossible that these parenchymal densities have progressed\nslightly and thus, further followup chest examinations in this\npatient with history of lymphoma is recommended.\n\n[**12-4**] CT Chest: 1. Widespread peripheral consolidations which\nare new or increasing. These are not entirely specific, but the\nstriking peripheral character of consolidations is very\nsuggestive of an inflammator etiology such as eosinophilic\npneumonia or organizing pneumonia, either of which could be\nassociated with a drug reaction. The appearance would be much\nless typical for an infectious etiology or progression of\nlymphoma, which has apparently responded overall very well to\ntreatment.\n\n2. New mild extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation of uncertain\nsignificance. Correlation with liver function tests is\nrecommended. If the apppearance may be clinically significant\nbased on laboratory data or clinical presentation, then MRCP\ncould be considered or follow-up CT or ultrasound. Extrinsic\ncompression by lymphadenopathy that is not imaged on this study\nis a possible, though somewhat unusual, possibility.\n\n[**12-4**] CT Head: 1. No evidence of intracranial metastatic\ndisease. MR (if feasible) would be more sensitive than CT for\ndetection of metastatic lesions. 2. No acute intracranial\nprocess.\n\n[**12-9**] CXR: Heart size is normal. Mediastinal position, contour,\nand width are unremarkable and stable. The abnormalities\ndemonstrated on prior chest\nradiograph and chest CT appears to be grossly unchanged except\nfor may be\nminimal progression at the level of the left lower lobe and\nright upper\nsuperficial area as well as interval development of minimal\namount of pleural effusion on the right. The finding continues\nto be nonspecific with the differential diagnosis being broad\nincluding eosinophilic pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing\npneumonia, drug reaction, and less likely infection.\n\nPATHOLOGY:\n[**11-17**] Bone marrow biopsy- MARKEDLY HYPERCELLULAR MARROW WITH\nEXTENSIVE INVOLVEMENT BY A LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER, MOST\nCONSISTENT WITH DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA.\n\n[**11-17**] R axillary lymph node biopsy- DIFFUSE LARGE B CELL\nLYMPHOMA, HIGH GRADE.\n\n[**11-17**] Immunophenotyping Flow Cytometry: Immunophenotypic finding\nconsistent with involvement by a kappa-restricted B-cell\nlymphoproliferative disorder.

Initial labs in\nthe ED were remarkable for lactic acidosis with HCO3 of 15 and a\nlactate of 7.9. On the medical floor, he was found to have a\nuric acid of 13.5 and an LDH of 604 in the setting of normal\ncalcium/ phosphate/ potassium. He was started on allopurinol and\nIVF due to concern for TLS. A heme-onc consult was called and an\naxillary LN biopsy showed prelimary path c/w aggressive\nlymphoma. Bone marrow biopsy eventually showed diffuse large B\ncell lymphoma. Patient was noted to have increased work of\nbreathing with ABG showing worsening acidosis 7.32/19/111 and\nlactate of 11.4. A bicarb drip was initiated and due to concern\nfor worsening lactic acidosis, patient was transferred to the\nICU. Lactic acidosis was attributed to tumor mass necrosis vs.\ninfection and patient was started on vanc/zosyn/azithro for\npneumonia visualized on CT chest (see below). He received [**Hospital1 **]\nfor treatment of his lymphoma and tumor lysis labs were\nmonitored q6 given his spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome on\nadmission. He received rasburicase for persistently elevated\nuric acid and new renal failure (creatinine 1.3 from 1.0) with\nimprovement of his symptoms. He became fluid overloaded and was\ndiuresed with lasix. He was called out to the floor where he\nreceived a round of RCHOP with good effect and no subsequent\ntumor lysis. He had some mucositis which was managed with pain\nmedications and mouth care.
