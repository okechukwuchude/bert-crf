There is also an echo report that comments on normal\nEF, moderately dilated LA, evidence of ASD repair although \"not\nclear if patch is still intact or not\", moderate MR, moderate TR\nand RVSP is 51mmHg.  Patient received two doses of 5mg vitamin K\nthe day prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]\nfor [**Hospital1 **] before a possible cholcystectomy.\n\nAt [**Hospital1 18**], she underwent [**Hospital1 **] with biliary stenting (no\nsphincteromy given INR 2.0) that was unremarkable without\nevidence of cholangitis or biliary obstruction.

Normal left ventricular systolic function.\n\nRecommend a cardiac MRI for more precise definition of\ncongenital anatomic abnormalities and quantification of\nintracardiac shunting.

Normal\nappearing bile ducts.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. [**Known lastname 9449**] is a 64yo F with history of mental retardation,\natrial fibrillation and CVA with left hemiplegia who was\ntransferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for [**Hospital1 **] and intubated for respiratory\ndistress likely secondary to volume overload & pneumonia;\nsuccessfully extubated on [**10-13**].\n\n# Respiratory distress: Patient was tachypneic to 20-30s while\nawaiting [**Month/Year (2) **] and intubated to protect her airway for the\nprocedure. She became hypoxic to 70s% during induction and\nremained intubated after the procedure. Respiratory distress\nlikely caused by CHF exacerbation secondary to volume overload,\nin addition to healthcare-associated pneumonia (BNP 3344). CXR\nwas concerning for infiltrate or pulmonary edema. Echo with EF\n>55% with mild pulmonary hypertension. Treated with vancomycin\nand cefepime for HCAP with a planned 8-day course (D1=[**10-10**],\nlast day [**10-17**]). She was treated with IV lasix for her volume\noverload.  Lasix was held on [**10-14**] due to agressive diuresis,\nbut redosed on the morning of discharge based on exam and repeat\nchest x-ray.  She should resume her usual home dose of oral\nlasix on [**10-16**].\n\n# LFT abnormalities: Her [**Month/Year (2) **] was unremarkable and did not show\nany frank pus from the biliary system s/p stent placement. Will\nneed repeat [**Month/Year (2) **] for stent removal in 2 months (appointment has\nalready been scheduled). LFTs trended down during admission.\n\n# Atrial fibrillation and h/o CVA: Coumadin was restarted when\nit was clear that the patient would not be undergoing any other\nprocedure during this admission. There had been a question of\nwhether she would be having a cholecystectomy but per the OSH\nthis was not planned or necessary. Increased dose to 5mg from\n2.5mg for subtherapeutic INR.  She will need close monitoring of\nher INR and adjustments of coumadin dosing until it stabilizes.\n\n\n# Hypertension: Lisinopril was initially held as patient was\nbeing diuresed with IV lasix. After diuresis was stopped,\nlisinopril was restarted at home dose.\n\n# Urinary tract infection: Final urine culture negative. OSH\nrecords report UTI.  Continued her on cefepime for biliary tract\ninfection which was adequate treatment for an uncomplicated UTI.\n\n# Prophylaxis: Patient received heparin products during this\nadmission.\n\n# Code status: Presumed full code.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nAcetaminophen 650mg qhs\nAcetaminophen 650mg q4-6 PRN\nDulcolax suppository 10mg PR daily PRN\nRefresh Tear 1 gtt OU 4XD\nCelexa 40mg daily\nColace 100mg [**Hospital1 **]\nFlonase 2 sprays each nostril daily\nLasix 40mg daily\nLisinopril 10mg qdaily\nMilk of Magnesia 30 mL daily PRN constipation\nMVI\nMylanta 30 mL q6 PRN gastric upset\nCoumadin 2.5mg daily\nLorazepam 1mg q6 PRN anxiety\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6\nhours) as needed for pain, fever: Do not exceed 4 grams/day.\n2. citalopram 20 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n\n3.

You were transfered from [**Hospital3 6592**] to have a procedure\ncalled an [**Hospital3 **].  You had a biliary stent placed during this\nprocedure and will need a repeat [**Hospital3 **] in 2 months as below.\nYour INR should be less than 1.5 at that time if possible.\n\n2. You were admitted to the intensive care unit after your [**Hospital3 **]\nfor difficulty breathing. You required a breathing tube, also\nknown as intubation. We removed the tube on [**10-13**]. You were\ntreated for healthcare-associated pneumonia with antibiotics and\nwe gave you medicine to help remove fluid from your body.  You\nwill need to continue taking antibiotics through [**2107-10-17**].\n\n3. You urine cultures were negative, but we had received a\nreport that they were positive at [**Hospital3 **]. We treated\nthis with the same antibiotics that we used to treat your\npneumonia.\n\n4. We restarted your coumadin at a higher dose because your INR\nwas too low.  You will need to have your INR checked every other\nday and you coumadin dose adjusted as needed.  The antibiotics\nmay be affecting your coumadin dosing.\n\n5. We made the following changes to your medications:\nSTARTED cefepime (last dose on [**10-17**])\nSTARTED vancomycin (last dose on [**10-17**])\nINCREASED warfarin dose to 5mg (adjust as necessary based on\nINR)\nSTARTED Heparin Flush (10 units/ml) 2 mL IV PRN line flush PICC\n\n6.
