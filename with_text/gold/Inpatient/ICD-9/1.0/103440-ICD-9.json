CVP indicates we have\n   not fully volume resuscitated the patient. Would give additional fluids\n   and attempt to wean levophed. If unable to do so despite CVP of 12 or\n   higher, would add vasopressin and consider ACTH stimulation,\n   particularly with hx of lung cancer.  Maintain antibiotics for possible\n   intra-abdominal source of infection. Oxygenation remains good with only\n   nasal supplementation.\n   Creat doubled from baseline. Probably relates to intravascular volume\n   depletion and hypotension; possible ATN. Creat down slightly this AM.\n   Would continue to support with fluids to raise CVP. Replete potassium.\n   Acid base status acceptable.\n   Mild anemia, likely related to underlying tumor. No evidence of active\n   bleeding.\n   Mild elevation in INR; possibly related to vitamin K deficiency.

DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA\n\n[**7-28**] EKG: Probable sinus rhythm with low amplitude P waves\n(visible in lead V1) versus ectopic atrial rhythm. Right\nbundle-branch block. Left anterior fascicular block. Q-T\ninterval prolongation. Compared to the previous tracing of\n[**2118-7-7**] P waves are less apparent. Q-T interval is more\nprolonged.\n\n[**7-28**] CXR: 1. Stable post-surgical changes in the right lung from\nprior right lower lobectomy and upper [**Month/Year (2) 3630**] wedge resection due\nto known non-small cell lung cancer.\n2. Hazy opacity in the left lower [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] reflect atelectasis.\n\n\n[**7-28**] CT Abd/pelvis:\n1. Bibasilar lung consolidations, worse when compared to prior\nexam.\nDifferential diagnosis includes infectious etiologies as well as\na slow\ngrowing lesion such as bronchoalveolar carcinoma. Clinical\ncorrelation is\nrecommended.\n2. No evidence of small bowel obstruction. Colon appears\nrelatively\nfeatureless with air-fluid levels and possibly pericolonic fat\nstranding\nversus third spacing. These findings may suggest a colitis.\n3. Extensive vascular calcifications.\n4. Large prostate.\n5. S1 vertebral body fracture with buckling of the superior\ncortex, worse\nwhen compared to prior exam.\n\n[**7-30**] Left LENI:\nIMPRESSION: No left lower extremity DVT.\n\n[**7-31**] KUB:\nFINDINGS:\nSmall bowel loops containing air are seen without distension.\nThere is a\npaucity of air in the left lower quadrant which might be due to\nliquid stool within the descending colon. No free air is seen on\nthe right lateral decubitus film. The visualized osseous\nstructures are unremarkable. The right lung base is not well\nseen with the dome of the diaghragm being pushed superiorly.\nThis correlates with the right lower [**Month/Year (2) 3630**] atelactasis on the\ncorresponding CT.\nIMPRESSION: No distended loops of bowel seen.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname 78131**] is a 78M with stage IV NSLC who presents with\nfevers from his rehab facility.\n.\n* Hypotension: Patient presented with hypotension concerning for\nsepsis.  He was briefly on levophed and was taken off of\npressors when SBP 100s-110s.  His hypotension was probably due\nto hypovolemia from diuresis but severe hypotension in setting\nof developing sepsis was also considered.  Lactate down to 1.0\nfrom 1.3 on admission with SVO2 73.\nOn the floors, his SBP's ranged in the 130's to 140's and he was\nrestarted on his home doses of LASIX WAS HELD FOR THE SEVERAL\nDAYS PRIOR TO DISCHARGE BECAUSE HE WAS AUTODIURESING.  HE NEEDS\nTO BE RE-EVALUATED REGULARLY FOR WHETHER LASIX NEEDS TO BE\nRESTARTED. HE WILL LIKELY NEED HIS LASIX RESTARTED AT SOME POINT\nAT REHAB.  His pressures remained stable throughout\nhospitalization.\n.\n* Fever: Patient's fever likely caused by C diff as patient is\ntoxin positive, although aspiration pneumonia was also\nconsidered a possibility given evidence of dysphagia on prior\nvideo swallow. His underlying pulmonary malignancy predisposes\nhim to a post-obstructive pneumonia. However the absence of\ncough or hypoxia made a pulmonary etiology less compelling.\nBlood and urine cultures are negative.  His C difficile colitis\nwas originally treated with PO vancomycin and IV flagyl. Prior\nto discharge, as diarrhea began to resolve, he was switched to\nPO flagyl alone, to be continued for a two week course (until\n[**2118-8-12**]).\n.\n* L leg swelling and pain: Patient had lower extremity pain\nedema greater on left than right after receiving fluid\nresuscitation in the ICU.  LENI showed no evidence of DVT. He\nwas diuresed with lasix until his fluid output was negative. He\nwas autodiuresing on discharge so his lasix was held. His fluid\nstatus should be reassessed daily to determine if he needs to be\nrestarted on lasix.\n\n* Hyponatremia: Patient's hyponatremia resolved after\nintravenous fluids, which supports hypovolemia as cause on\nadmission.  Review of OMR shows Na's running ~130. At last\ndischarge, thought to have a component of SIADH.\n\n* Acute renal failure: Patient had creatinine elevated to 1.4\nand FeNa was 0.1 on admission.  Creatinine has improved to\n0.7-0.8 (his baseline). His acute renal failure has resolved and\nwas likely pre-renal as it improved with IVF.\n\n* Anemia:  His hematocrit is down from admission but suspect\nthis was secondary to hemoconcentration.  His anemia is\nconsistent with baseline.\n\n* NSCLC: Advanced disease, on palliative chemotherapy.  Social\nwork and palliative care were consulted throughout this\nhospitalization and discussed goals of care with the family.\nErlotinib will be restarted on [**2118-8-19**] and should be taked every\nother day. He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].\n\n* Atrial fibrillation: His sotalol was restarted now that his\nhypotension resolved.\n\n# Nutrition ?????? Patient has aspiration risks and is unable to\nswallow pills easily. He was evaluated by nutrition and kept on\na pureed diet with TID ensure.  He also had an elevated INR\ndespite not being on anticoagulation which possibly could be due\nto malnutrition.  INR improved after administration of one dose\nof vitamin K.\n\n# Oral thrush: Patient failed nystatin swish and swallow. He was\nloaded with 400mg fluconazole and should continue 200mg daily\nuntil [**2118-8-25**].\n\n#Pain control: Patient was maintained on methadone and diluadid\nPRN during hospitalization. His methadone should be tapered and\npain reassessed daily while in rehab.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nAt rehab:\nErlotinib 100mg daily\nSimvastatin 10mg daily\nLasix 20mg daily\nSotalol 80mg [**Hospital1 **]\nNifedipine 30mg daily\nMethadone 15mg tid\nFolate\nLidoderm patch\n[**Name (NI) **], [**Name (NI) 78132**], MOM, dulcolax, lactulose, senna, guiafenesin,\ncolace, tylenol all prn\nZofran prn\nNeurontin 300mg q12h\nHeparin 5000 units SQ TID\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
