He underwent chemotherapy and\nradiation and had an excellent response by\nrepeat PET imaging. He presented to the OR on [**2110-8-27**] for\nMinimally-invasive esophagectomy, EGD and laparoscopic\njejunostomy tube placement. His operation was without\ncomplication, and he was extubated without difficulty. He\nremained in the surgical ICU POD0 and was transferred to the\nfloor on POD1. His pain was initially well controlled with an\nepidural, and once removed on POD1 was well controlled on a\ndilaudid PCA, IV toradol, and transitioned to oral pain\nmedications when he was tolerating clears. He began J-tube feeds\non POD1, with the nutrition service providing relevant\nrecommendations. He tolerated his feeds well. His NGT was\ndiscontinued on POD4. An UGI study on [**2110-9-2**] did not show\nevidence of any anastamotic leak, and therefore his mediastinal\nchest tube and [**Doctor Last Name **] were removed on this date (POD6). On POD7\nhe did complain of increased heartburn with clears, and CXR\nshowed a slightly enlarged conduit. Given his symptoms, he was\ntaken back to the OR on [**2110-9-5**] for EGD, dilation of pylorus with\n20 mm radial balloon, and inkection of pylorus with 200u Botox.\nHe tolerated the procedure well, and post-operatively no longer\nhad heart burn symptoms. His pathology returned T1bN0Mx- 33 mm\nmargin,perinueral,lmphatic and venous invasion absent. He was\nfollowed by the [**Hospital **] clinic while inpatient given elevated\nFSGs while on TF, and should follow up with [**Last Name (un) **] as an\noutpatient. He will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on discharge. VNA\nwas arranged on discharge to assist him with his tube feeding at\nhome.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nAlbuterol inh, insulin (levemir), omeprazole 40''\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. oxycodone-acetaminophen 5-325 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: 5-10 MLs\nPO Q3H (every 3 hours) as needed for pain.\nDisp:*500 ML(s)* Refills:*2*\n2. docusate sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: [**1-5**]  PO BID (2 times a\nday) as needed for constipation.\nDisp:*250 ml* Refills:*2*\n3. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a\nday) as needed for constipation.\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*1*\n4.
