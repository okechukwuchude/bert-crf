There is persistent mild engorgement of\nthe pulmonary vessels.\n.\n[**2185-1-6**] Intraop TEE:\nPRE-CPB:\nThe left atrium is moderately dilated. No thrombus is seen in\nthe left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D\nor color Doppler.\nLeft ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left\nventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular\nsystolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Hypokinesis is noted in\nthe mid inferior and inferoseptal walls. Right ventricular\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal.\nThere are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are\ncomplex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.\nThe aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with\ngood leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic\nregurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate\n([**11-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.\nDr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at time\nof study.\nPOST-CPB:\nThe patient is on a phenylephrine infusion. The mid inferior and\ninferoseptal segments appear severely hypokinetic bordering on\nakinetic, which is worse than pre-bypass. Other wall segments\nare contracting well. Overall estimated systolic EF=50%. The\nright ventricular systolic function is preserved.\nValve function remains unchanged. There is no evidence of\ndissection.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMrs. [**Known lastname 19122**] was admitted and underwent routine preoperative\nevaluation. She remained pain free on medical therapy and was\ncleared for surgery. On [**1-6**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed\ncoronary artery bypass grafting surgery. For surgical details,\nplease see operative note. In summary she had:\n1. Urgent coronary artery bypass graft x4 left internal mammary\nartery to left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein\ngrafts to obtuse marginal 1 and 2\n    posterior descending artery.\n2. Endoscopic harvesting of the long saphenous vein.\nCardiopulmonary bypass time was 89 minutes with a crossclamp\ntime of 80 minutes. She tolerated the operation well and\nfollowing the operation, she was brought to the CVICU for\ninvasive monitoring. In the immediate post-op period she\nremained hemodynamically stable, woke neurologically intact and\nextubated later that day. She continued to be hemodynamically\nstable throughout POD1 and transferred to the floor on POD2 for\nfurther recovery and post operative care. Chest tubes and pacing\nwires removed per cardiac surgery protocol. the patient started\non Bblockers and was gently diuresed toward her preop weight. On\nthe stepdown floor she was noted to have bursts of Atrial\nFibrillation and was started on amiodarone and coumadin for\nanticoagulation, following which she converted to sinus rhythm.\nThe remainder of her hospital course was largely uneventful. She\nworked with nursing and physical therapy, however progress was\nslow and she was cleared for discharge to Nevins Nursing and\nRehab in [**Location (un) 7661**] on POD #7. Target INR 2.0-2.5 for A Fib. First\nblood draw tomorrow [**1-14**].
