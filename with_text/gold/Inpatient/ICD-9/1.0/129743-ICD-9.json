Patient [**Month/Day/Year 1834**] preop cardiac evaluation today with\nMIBI and was found to have new onset atrial fibrillation with\nRVR 120's. Cardiologists\nrecommended no additional work up since patient was without\nangina or other symptoms of ischemia.

He was extubated\nwithout difficulty in the OR and was admitted to the ICU for\nmanagement of atrial fibrillation with sick sinus syndrome. The\nrest of Mr. [**Known lastname 20693**] hospital course is described below by\nsystem:\n\n1. Respiratory:\nPostoperatively, Mr. [**Known lastname 20692**] was kept on 4L of oxygen by nasal\ncannula with O2 sats >95% and was breathing comfortably with\npain control by bupivicaine epidural and dilaudid PCA. Chest\ntube had minimal serosanginous ouput with no leak detected. On\nPOD#2, patient had an episode of desaturation to high 80s on\n100% O2. CXR showed complete collapse of left lung. Bronchoscopy\nwas performed with removal of copious clear mucus plugs from\nleft mainstem and LUL bronchi. Patient was placed on BIPAP\novernight for improved ventilation. AM CXR on POD#3 showed\nre-expansion of lung and patient was started on nebulizer\ntreatments, with improvement in dyspnea, cough production, and\noxygen saturation. Chest tube was removed on POD#4 without\nevidence of pneumothorax on post-pull CXR. Oxygen was gradually\nweaned to 2L and patient was transferred to the floor on POD#5.\nWith chest PT and continued nebs, oxygen was weaned completely\nby POD#5 during rest and exertion. Patient was discharged home\non POD#6 with O2 sats >98% on room air and arrangements for VNA\nand nebulizer treatments at home.\n2. Cardiac:\nMr. [**Known lastname 20693**] newly diagnosed afib was present throughout his\npostoperative period. He was started on IV lopressor and\ntransitioned to po lopressor with dose titrated to keep rate\nless than 120. He did not experience any ischemic symptoms\nthroughout this period. He was started on coumadin on POD#6, as\nper his cardiologist, with plans to follow up with his PCP for\ncoumadin dosing.\n3.
