He was found to have mitral\nregurgitation which was subsequently followed by serial\nechocardiograms by multiple physicians as he moves frequently.\nHis echocardiogram last year showed moderate to severe mitral\nvalve prolapse with 3+ mitral regurgitation. A cardiac MRI was\nobtained which showed bileaflet mitral valve prolapse with\nmoderate mitral regurgitation. The LVEF was mildly depressed at\n48%. The effective forward LVEF was moderately depressed at 35%.\nHe is symptomatic with mainly fatigue however he does note\noccasional palpitations.\n\nWhen we saw him in [**2196**] surgery was recommended but cardiology\ndecided to postpone surgery and treat his ventricular ectopy in\nhopes to improve his LV systolic function and dimensions. Holter\nmonitor study in [**2197-12-10**] still showed significant amount of\nectopy, and he has persistent symptoms due to this, albeit less\nfrequent. Recent Echo on [**2198-4-24**] revealed moderate/severe mitral\nvalve bileaflet prolapse involving all anterior segment and all\nposterior scallops with moderate to severe (3+) mitral\nregurgitation.\n\nPast Medical History:\nMitral valve regurgitation s/p mitral valve repair\nPast medical history:\n- Hypertension\n- Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia\n- Anxiety\n- ? syncopal event [**5-21**]\n- + PPD [**2181**], negative CXR\n\n\nSocial History:\nRace: Caucasian\nLast Dental Exam: 6 months ago\nLives with: College roommate\nContact: [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 89423**]               Phone # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 89424**]\nOccupation: He is a CEO of a series of call centers called the\nVTW Company.

Two older\nbrothers, one with hypertension, the other with no known cardiac\ndisease. His mother has asthma and his father died of cancer.\nThere is no family history of sudden cardiac death.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nPulse: 80  Resp: 16  O2 sat: 100%\nB/P Left: 114/80\nHeight: 5'[**96**]\"    Weight: 225\n\nGeneral: Well-developed male in no acute distress\nSkin: Dry [X] intact [X]\nHEENT: PERRLA [X] EOMI [X]\nNeck: Supple [X] Full ROM [X]\nChest: Lungs clear bilaterally [X]\nHeart: RRR [X] Irregular [] Murmur [X] grade 236 late systolic\nAbdomen: Soft [X] non-distended [X] non-tender [X] bowel sounds\n+ [X]\nExtremities: Warm [X], well-perfused [X] Edema/Varicosities:\nNone [X]\nNeuro: Grossly intact [X]\nPulses:\nFemoral      Right: 2+  Left: 2+\nDP           Right: 2+  Left: 2+\nPT           [**Name (NI) 167**]: 2+  Left: 2+\nRadial       Right: 2+  Left: 2+\n\nCarotid Bruit      Right: -   Left: -\n\nPertinent Results:\n[**2198-5-21**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen\nin the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No\natrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left\nventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular\ncavity is moderately dilated. There is mild regional left\nventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior and\ninferoseptal hypokinesis. There is mild to moderate global left\nventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic\nfunction is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good\nleaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic\nregurgitation. There is moderate/severe posterior leaflet mitral\nvalve prolapse, worst at P2. The entire anterior leaflet\nprolapses as well, but to a lesser degree than the posterior\nleaflet. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of moderate to\nsevere (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric\nnature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly\nunderestimated (Coanda effect). There is no pericardial\neffusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at time\nof surgery.\nPOST-BYPASS: The patient is AV paced. The patient is on an\nepinephrine infusion. Left ventricular function remains\ndepressed, with an LVEF = 35%. Lateral wall motion remains\nunchanged from prebypass. Right ventricular function appears\nmildly depressed. There is a mitral annuloplasty ring in place.\nTrace mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a mean gradient of\n4mmHg across the mitral valve at a cardiac output of 5.6 L/min.\nThere is no systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve and no\nincreased LVOT gradient. The aorta is intact post-decannulation.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 89425**] was a same day admit and brought directly to\nthe operating room where he underwent a mitral valve repair.\nPlease see operative note for surgical details. Following\nsurgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring\nin stable condition. Later this day he was weaned from sedation,\nawoke neurologically intact and extubated.  Post-operatively his\nrhythm was junctional/brady requiring pacing.  Nodal agents were\nheld.  He subsequently developed atrial fibrillation with slow\nventricular response.  He remained hemodynamically stable.   He\nwas started on Sotalol and beta-blocker was held.  Rhythm\nconverted to Sinus.  He was gently diuresed toward the\npreoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the\ntelemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing\nwires were discontinued without complication.  The patient was\nevaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with\nstrength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD #5 the\npatient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain\nwas controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged\non POD#5 in good condition with appropriate follow up\ninstructions.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nPreadmission medications listed are correct and complete.\nInformation was obtained from webOMR.\n1.
