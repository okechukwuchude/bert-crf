Reports going to multiple ED's\nwith these symptoms and has just been given pain medication\nwithout much relief. Today after having an outpt MRI he was sent\nhere with report of L3-L4 tumor.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nNone\n\nSocial History:\nUnemployed at this time, lives with some friends,\ndenies smoking and ETOH\n\n\nFamily History:\nMother died due to cardiac related event\n\nPhysical Exam:\nT:97.2  BP:158/92    HR:82    RR:18       O2Sats:94\nGen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD.\nHEENT:Atraumatic Pupils: 2.5->2        EOMs full\nNeck: Supple.\nExtrem: Warm and well-perfused.\nNeuro:\nMental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal\naffect.\nOrientation: Oriented to person, place, and date.\nMotor:\n      D    B     T    FE   FF    IP    Q     AT    [**Last Name (un) 938**]    G\n\nSensation: Intact to light touch however posterior portion of R\nleg is hypersensitive and sl. decrease sensation in R leg.\nReflexes: B T Br Pa Ac\nRight            2  2\nLeft             2  2\n\nToes downgoing bilaterally\nRectal exam normal sphincter control\n3 beat clonus on L\n\n\nPertinent Results:\nMRI LUMBAR SPINE ON ADMITION:\n\nFINDINGS: A 13 x 42 mm irregularly enhancing mass is noted\nwithin the thecal sac, centered at the L4 vertebral level. The\nmass essentially fills the thecal sac and approximates the right\nlateral dural margin. There is presumed splaying of the cauda\nequina at this location. It is not possible to determine, given\nthe size of this lesion whether the mass arises from a\nnerve rootlet.\nThere is a minimally bulging disc at the L2-3 and L3-4 levels.\nThere is also mild disc space narrowing at L2-3. At L5-S1, there\nis a minimally bulging, mildly narrowed disc with type 2\ndegenerative endplate change oN either side of the disc.\nThere is no other overt lumbar spinal abnormality seen.\nThe visualized distal spinal cord, conus medullaris, and\nremainder of the\ncauda equina are normal.\nCONCLUSION: Large intradural mass. The finding likely represents\na neoplasm.\nA large schwannoma, as opposed to an ependymoma could be\nconsidered. A drop metastasis seems less likely, as does an\ninflammatory process.\nAn attempt was made to page you, but you were not available.
