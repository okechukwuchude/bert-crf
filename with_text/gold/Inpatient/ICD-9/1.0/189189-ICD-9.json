He is being admitted to the CCU for\nmonitoring.\n.\nCardiac catheterisation revealed tight stenosis with\ncalcification near the prior LAD lesion.  Drug-eluting stent was\nplaced, jailing the diagonal, which remained occluded.  He\nexperienced some chest pain peri-procedurally, which improved\nwith 20 mcg nitroglycerin.  Radial access for cath was\nattempted, but failed due to vessel tortuosity.  TR band was\nplaced on right wrist.  Femoral access was obtained instead and\nwas successful.  He has been hemodynamically stable since the\nprocedure.  .  He is receiving peri-procedural integrillin and\nis on a nitro drip for chest pain.\n.\nThe patient reports that approximately three weeks ago he had\nsevere heartburn and nausea which was very similar to what he\nexperienced with his MI in [**2105**].  He did not seek treatment for\nthis and his symptoms eventually went away. Again last week, the\npatient had similar \"heartburn symptoms\" with radiation to the\njaw and throat. These symptoms occurred at night and were\nassociated with nausea but no vomiting. He was evaluated at\n[**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he ruled\nout for an MI. It was felt that his symptoms were more likely GI\nin origin and he was discharged to home on Pantoprazole and his\nnormal cardiac medications.\n.\nHis most recent events include an MI in [**2105**] while in\n[**State 4565**], requiring RCA stenting x [**Street Address(2) 28710**] elevation\nIMI in [**2107-3-1**] while on Plavix therapy.  At this time he\nwas treated at [**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center where a drug eluting stent\nwas placed in the posterolateral branch of the RCA at a site of\nISR. LVEF by ventriculogram was preserved at 57%. A residual LAD\nstenosis of 50% was mentioned. Prasugrel was added to his\nmedical regimen.\n.\nContinuing to have 5/10 chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, LE\nedema, orthopnea, PND, lightheadedness, claudication\n.\nOn review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,\nTIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the\ntime of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black\nstools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or\nrigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the\nother review of systems were negative.\n.\nCardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,\ndyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,\nankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.\n\nPast Medical History:\n1.

His last myocardial infarction was on [**2107-3-5**] in\n[**State 1727**]. He\nhad a right postero-lateral in-stent restenosis that was\nre-stented and\nhe was changed from plavix to prasugrel at that time. He has\nalso had\nstents placed to his LAD and RCA in multiple other facilities.\nOver the\nlast few months he has had episodes of chest burning consistent\nwith his\nsymptoms prior to his previous myocardial infarctions. He\nunderwent\nexercise-ECG testing which was non-diagnostic and is now\nreferred for\ncardiac catheterization.\n\nINDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:\nCoronary artery disease, Canadian Heart Class II,  stable.\nPrior non q\nwave inferior MI, [**2107-3-5**].  Prior PTCA [**2107-3-5**].  ETT\n\nPROCEDURE:\nPercutaneous coronary revascularization was performed using\nplacement of\ndrug-eluting stent(s).\nConscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring\nperformed by\na member of the nursing staff.\n\nHEMODYNAMICS RESULTS BODY SURFACE AREA:  2.07 m2\n  HEMOGLOBIN: 12.9 gms %\n  FICK\n**PRESSURES\nAORTA {s/d/m} 114/72/88\n**CARDIAC OUTPUT\nHEART RATE {beats/min} 46\n\n**PTCA RESULTS\n  LAD\n\nPTCA COMMENTS:\nInitial angiography showed 70% stenosis in mid LAD prior to\nprevious\nstent. We planned to treat this with PTCA and stenting. Due to\nextreme\ntortuosity of the right subclavian artery, we performed the PCI\nfrom the\nRFA. HEparin and integrilin were started prophylactically. A 6F\nXB 3.5\nguiding catheter provided adequate support for the procedure. A\nBMW wire\ncrossed the LAD lesion with minimal difficulty. The LAD lesion\nwas\ndilated with a 2.5x10mm Spriter legend balloon at 12-14 atms. A\n2.5x15mm\nPromus [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] was deployed in the mid LAD at 14 atms.\nInterval\nangiography showed occlusion of a small caliber, medium sized\ndiagonal\nbranch. The patient did experience chest pain at this point. The\nstent\nwas postdilated with a 2.5x12mm NC Quantum apex balloon at 12\nand 22\natms. Despite nitroglycerin, the diagonal remained occluded.\nMulitple\nattempts were made to cross into the occluded diagonal (BMW,\nprowater,\nPT [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] intermediate, and Run-through wires), however, we\nwere unable\nto wire the diagonal. Final angiography showed no residual\nstenosis in\nthe LAD and occluded diagonal branch that had been jailed by the\nstent.\nThere were faint collaterals to the diagonal territory. There\nwas no\nangiographically apparent dissection and tIMI 3 flow in the LAD.\nThe\npatient was started on IV nitroglycerin with improving chest\npain. The\npatient was transferred to CCU for monitoring in stable\ncondition.\n\n\nTECHNICAL FACTORS:\nTotal time (Lidocaine to test complete) = 1 hour 49 minutes.\nArterial time = 1 hour 45 minutes.\nFluoro time = 48.8 minutes.\nEffective Equivalent Dose Index = 2850 mGy.\nContrast injected:\n          Non-ionic low osmolar (isovue, optiray...), vol 155 ml\n\nPremedications:\n          Midazolam 1 mg IV\n          Fentanyl 100 mcg IV\n          ASA 325 mg P.O.\nAnesthesia:\n          1% Lidocaine subq.\nAnticoagulation:\n          Heparin 8000 units IV\nOther medication:\n          Atropine 0.5mg\n          Eptifibatide 32mg bolus and 28.4ml/hr drip\n          TNG 400mcg bolus IA\n          TNG 30mcg/hr drip\n          Verapamil 5mg IA\nCardiac Cath Supplies Used:\n          - [**Company **], MAGIC TORQUE 180CM\n          - [**Doctor Last Name **], BMW UNIVERSAL 190CM\n          - [**Doctor Last Name **], PROWATER 190CM\n          - [**Company **], CHOICE PT [**Name (NI) **] INTERMEDIATE\n300CM\n          2.5MM [**Company **], SPRINTER 06MM\n          2.5MM [**Company **], APEX 12\n          5FR CORDIS, XB 3.5\n          6FR CORDIS, XB 3.5\n          6FR [**Doctor Last Name **], PERCLOSE PROGLIDE\n          5FR COOK, [**Last Name (un) 28712**] 70CM\n          5FR COOK, [**Last Name (un) 28712**] 90CM\n          2.5MM [**Company **], PROMUS RX 15MM\n          - ALLEGIANCE, CUSTOM STERILE PACK\n          - MERIT, LEFT HEART KIT\n          5FR TERUMO, JACKY RADIAL CATHETER\n          5FR ARROW, TRANSRADIAL ARTERY ACCESS KIT\n          - TERUMO, ANGLED 260CM GLIDEWIRE\n          - [**Doctor Last Name **], PRIORITY PACK 20/30\n          - TERUMO, TR BAND LARGE\n\n\nCOMMENTS:\n1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system\ndemonstrated single vessel coronary disease. The LMCA was\npatent. The\nLAD had a 70% stenosis proximal to the prior stent. There were\nalso\nstenoses to 20-30% in the mid and distal LAD. The LCX had mild\nluminal\nirregularities. The RCA had widely patent stents with less than\n20-30%\nnarrowings in the mid-distal vessel.\n2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normotension.\n3. There was extreme tortuosity in the right subclavian artery\nthat\nrequired placement of a 5 French [**Last Name (un) 12297**] sheath into the ascending\naorta.\nThe diagnostic procedure was then performed via the right radial\nartery.\n4. Successful PTCA and stenting of mid LAD with 2.5x15mm Promus\ndrug\neluting stent postdilated with 2.5 Nc balloon, jailing diagonal.\n\n5. Unsuccessful attempt to rescue jailed diagonal (unable to\nwire).\n6.Successful hemostasis of RRA with TR band.\n7. Successful closure of RFA arteritomy with Perclose.\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:\n1. One vessel coronary artery disease.\n2. Successful PCI of LAD with DES; diagonal branch jailed.\n3. Unsuccessful attempt to rescue jailed diagonal.\n4. Successful RRA TR band.\n5.

We treated your pain and your blood tests and\nsymptoms improved overnight.\n\nWe made the following changes to your medications:\n\nSTOPPED Pantoprazole\nINCREASED Atorvastatin to 80 mg daily\n\nPlease continue taking your other medications as usual.  Please\nnote that it is very improtant that you consistently take\nPRASUGREL and ASPIRIN following your stent placement, and that\nfailure to take these medications may result in your stents\nbecoming blocked.\n\nPlease followup with your doctors, see below.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nPlease call your cardiologist's office on Monday to schedule a\nfollowp appointment within 15 days following discharge.\nPlease also call your primary care practioner's office on Monday\nand schedule an appointment within 5 days following discharge to\ndiscuss this hospitalization.\n\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2108-2-25**]"
