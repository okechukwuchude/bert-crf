No 2D or Doppler evidence of distal arch coarctation.\n\nAORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR\nleaflets move normally. Trace AR.\n\nMITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)\nMR. Prolonged (>250ms) transmitral E-wave decel time.\n\nTRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.\nNormal PA systolic pressure.\n\nPULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.\nNo PS. Physiologic PR.\n\nPERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.\n\nConclusions\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are\nnormal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are\nnormal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The\naortic valve prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally. Trace\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are\nmildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic\npressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial\neffusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall\nthickness with preserved global and regional biventricular\nsystolic function. Increased left ventricular filling pressure.\nWell-seated, normally functioning aortic valve bioprosthesis\nwith borderline-elevated transaortic valvular mean pressure\ngradients (19 mmHg). Normal pulmonary artery systolic pressure.\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-12-1**], a\nbioprosthetic aortic valve is now present. The pulmonary artery\nsystolic pressure has normalized.\n\nCXR: IMPRESSION: [**2172-12-13**] Right apical pneumothorax is tiny and\nunchanged. Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable and\nbibasilar atelectasis has improved. Heart size is normal. Right\njugular line ends low in the SVC. No pulmonary edema.\n\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nOn [**2172-12-8**] Mr.[**Known lastname 23903**] was taken to the operating room and\nunderwent Aortic valve replacement(#27 mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic Ultra\naortic valve bioprosthesis)/Coronary artery bypass grafting x3\n(left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending\ncoronary artery; reverse saphenous vein single graft from aorta\nto the ramus intermedius coronary artery; reverse saphenous vein\nsingle graft from the aorta to the distal  right coronary\nartery) with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. Please see operative report for\nfurther details.CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS TIME:  144\nminutes.CROSSCLAMP TIME:  123 minutes. He tolerated the\nprocedure well and transferred to the CVICU intubated and\nsedated. He awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. He\nweaned off pressor support and initially Beta-blocker was held\ndue to nodal rhythm. Statin/Aspirin and diuresis were\ninitiatited. All lines and drains were discontinued per\nprotocol. POD#1 he was transferred to the step down unit for\nfurther monitoring. Physical Therapy was consulted for\nevaluation of strength and mobility. POD#3 he went into rate\ncontrolled atrial fibrillation/flutter. He was placed on\nBeta-blocker and oral Amiodarone. Anticoagulation with Coumadin\nwas initiated. His INR went from 1.0->2.4->3.2 and he was given\n0 mg Coumadin on [**2172-12-14**] with repeat INR on [**2172-12-15**] scheduled.\nINR goal 2.0-3.0 - [**Hospital 2274**] [**Hospital3 271**] to provide\nfurther Coumadin instructions. On [**2172-12-13**] he was transfused\nwith 2 units of PRBC for HCT of 21.8 which increased to Hct of\n27.2. He was given Folic acid, iron and Vitamin C for post op\nanemia. He continue to progress and on POD 6 he was cleared for\ndischarge to home with VNA services.
