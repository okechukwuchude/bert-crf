Of note, he has\nGuillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome and is currently wheelchair bound due to\nlower extremity weakness.\n.\nHe was diagnosed with cirrhosis in [**4-/2173**] and was unaware of his\nliver disease prior to then.  Per patient report, he has had\nparacentesis about twice monthly since then with volumes of [**7-16**]\nL.  He reports failing diuretic therapy due to symptomatic\nhypotension.  He also reports that he has had endoscopy showing\nmild varices and denies ever having upper or lower GI bleeding.\n.\nPer the patient, he has needed recurrent paracentesis over the\npast few months despite being on Furosemide and Spironolactone.\nHis hepatologist suggested a TIPS procedure to relieve the\nrecurrent ascites and hepatic hydrothorax which he has had over\nthe past year.  The patient states that he initially went to\n[**Hospital1 **] to have the TIPS procedure done, but later requested a\ntransfer since he wanted one of the [**Hospital1 18**] IR physicians to do\nthe procedure.\n.\nPer the transfer summary he was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on\n[**2173-9-18**] for increasing ascites and hypotension.  The transfer\nsummary is confusing but it appears as if there was a concern\nfor SBP.  He was given an albumin infusion which was later\ndiscontinued due to pleural effusion.  He was then seen by\nPulmonary who noted his cirrhosis, ascites, and a large pleural\neffusion. They decided to observe him, and offered thoracentesis\nfor to help with dyspnea.  The patient declined thoracentesis.\nAccording to the patient, he received [**4-12**] large volume\nparacentesis taps ranging from 8-9 L a tap.  He states that\nduring his hospitalization his diuretic therapy was stopped\nbecause he was hypotensive and required albumin infusions.\n.\nROS was otherwise essentially negative. The patient denied\nrecent fevers, night sweats, chills, hematemesis, coffee-ground\nemesis, nausea, vomiting, melena, hematochezia.  He does have\nsignificant lower extremity weakness due to his ongoing\nGuillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.\n.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nGuillain-[**Location (un) **] Syndrome\nAlcoholic Cirrhosis\nPortal Hypertension\nPostural Hypotension\nAnemia\nAnxiety\nGait disorder\n\n\nSocial History:\nHe previously worked as a dentist.

Abdominal paracentesis.\n2. Right pleural thoracocentesis.\n3. Hepatic venography via right internal jugular vein approach.\n4. Unsuccessful transhepatic cannulation of the portal vein.\nHISTORY: 64-year-old man with cirrhosis and intractable ascites,\nrequires TIPS for control of ascites and recurrent right-sided\nhydrothorax.\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia was provided by the\nanesthesiology service. In addition, 1% lidocaine was\nadministered to the skin around the internal jugular vein\npuncture, thoracocentesis and paracentesis site.\nRADIOLOGIST: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4401**], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]\nand Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12166**] performed the procedure. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12166**], the\nattending radiologist, was present throughout the procedure.\nPROCEDURE: Informed consent was obtained outlining the risks and\nbenefits of the procedure involved. Following this, the patient\nwas brought to the angiography suite where general anesthesia\nwas induced. The right neck and right-sided chest and upper\nabdomen were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A\npreprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 18**]\nprotocol. Ultrasound of the right side demonstrates a large\nright-sided pleural effusion and a large volume of ascites.\nUnder ultrasound guidance, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 11097**] centesis needle was positioned\nwithin the peritoneal space and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7648**] wire advanced under\nfluoroscopic guidance. A 5 French OmniFlush catheter was then\nadvanced over the wire and attached to a suction drainage\ndevice. Again under ultrasound guidance and following\nadministration of 1% lidocaine, a 7 French all purpose drainage\ncatheter was advanced into the right pleural space and again\nattached to a underwater seal on suction drainage. Both drainage\ncatheters were secured.\nAttention was then turned to access the right internal jugular\nvein. 1% lidocaine was administered to the skin overlying the\ninternal jugular vein and under direct ultrasound guidance, a\nmicropuncture needle advanced into the right internal jugular\nvein. A 4.5 French micropuncture sheath was advanced over an 018\nnitinol wire. The 018 wire and inner dilator were removed and an\n035 [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire advanced into the IVC. The micropuncture sheath\nwas removed and the venotomy site dilated with an 8 French\ndilator. The sheath was then advanced to the level of the origin\nof the hepatic veins and a 035 Glidewire advanced into the right\nhepatic vein. The sheath was advanced over the wire to lie in\nthe mid portion of the right hepatic vein. Pressure gradients\nwere obtained at this time. Following this, a 5 French 035\nocclusive balloon was advanced into the distal right hepatic\nvein branch and CO2 portography was performed to evaluate the\nposition of the right and left main portal vein. AP and lateral\nprojections were obtained. Following this, the Roshida needle\nwas used to attempt to access the portal vein from the right\nhepatic vein approach. Despite multiple needle passes in\nmultiple orientations, it was not possible to enter the portal\nvein and advance a wire. In addition, an attempt was made to by\nthe portal vein via a right flank percutaneous transhepatic\napproach. Again despite multiple wire passes, we were unable to\nsufficiently opacify the portal vein. Following a total\nprocedure time of 6 hours and a fluoroscopic time of 80 minutes,\na decision was made to abort the procedure. The internal jugular\nvein access sheath was removed and manual pressure was applied\nfor 10 minutes, ensuring good hemostasis. The peritoneal\ndrainage catheter was removed over a wire and a sterile dressing\napplied. A 7 French right pleural drain was left in situ to\ncontinue pleural drainage and lung expansion. The catheter was\nattached to an underwater seal. The referring clinician, Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) **], was contact[**Name (NI) **] at the time of procedure. There were no\nearly complications and the patient was extubated in the\nangiography suite and transferred to the anesthesia care unit.\nFINDINGS: Ultrasound demonstrated large volume right-sided\npleural effusion and ascites. There was uncomplicated placement\nof right pleural and right peritoneal drainage catheter. Portal\nvenography demonstrated a markedly narrowed right hepatic vein.\nIn addition, CO2 portography demonstrated a small right portal\nvein branch. Given the overall anatomy and severe background\nascites added to the difficulty in accessing the portal vein\ntranshepatically.\nCONCLUSION: Successful right-sided thoracocentesis and abdominal\nparacentesis. Hepatic venography and pressure measurements. The\nright atrial pressure was measured at 8 mmHg. The hepatic wedge\npressure was measured at 20 mmHg. The staff radiologist, Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) 12166**], has reviewed the report.\n.\n.\nCT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST\tStudy Date of [**2173-10-12**] 1:03 PM\nHISTORY: Alcoholic cirrhosis with known portal hypertension,\nstatus post attempted TIPS procedure x2, most recent complicated\nby hepatic venous arterial fistula and subsequent embolization.\nEvaluate for subcapsular or retroperitoneal bleed.\nCOMPARISON: Outside CT [**2173-9-22**], as well as angiogram\nimages from [**2173-10-11**].\nCT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST\nLimited evaluation of the included lung bases displays\nnormal-appearing left lung. The right lung displays significant\ninterval decrease in size to a now slightly high-attenuation\nsmall-to-moderate pleural effusion with persistent adjacent\ncompressive atelectasis involving portions of the right lower\nlobe as well as the small locule of air noted posterior to the\nsternum and a small anterior pneumothorax present.\nUnenhanced images of the abdomen display no large\nretroperitoneal or subcapsular hematoma. There has been interval\ndecrease in the amount of ascites when compared to the prior\noutside imaging; however, the fluid is now more mixed density\nwith Hounsfield values measuring 20-30, suggestive of a mixture\nof underlying ascites hemorrhage likely related to some oozing\nafter capsular puncture on TIPS attempt. Contrast is noted\nwithin the gallbladder and there is streak artifact from the\nindwelling coils and Amplatz occluder devices in the right\nhepatic artery. Distal to these devices, the hepatic parenchyma\ndisplays abnormal low attenuation, which may suggest underlying\ninfarction given the poor flow noted on the post-embolization\nangiogram images to this region. Some residual air is noted\nwithin the liver parenchyma likely related to a recent\nprocedure. Multiple small hypoattenuating lesions in the liver\nare again seen, likely hepatic cysts and there is unchanged\nconfiguration to known underlying cirrhosis with sequelae of\nportal hypertension including splenomegaly, massive\nesophageal/paraesophageal varices, and intra-abdominal\ncollateral vessels. Limited unenhanced evaluation of the\nremaining solid organs within the abdomen including the pancreas\nand adrenal glands are normal. Kidneys displays persistent\ncorticomedullary differentiation involving the kidneys\nsuggestive of underlying renal dysfunction from prior contrast\nadministration one day prior. There are some prominent\nair-filled loops of small and large bowel with the small bowel\nmeasuring up to 3.4 cm, which may suggest some mild underlying\nileus with no findings of obstruction. Scattered mesenteric and\nretroperitoneal lymph nodes are better appreciated on prior\ncontrast-enhanced CT.\nCT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS OR ORAL CONTRAST:\nSignificant interval decrease in amount of free fluid within the\npelvis is identified, although the fluid is noted to be slightly\nhigher in attenuation as compared to the prior outside exam with\nHounsfield value of approximately 20. A large fecal ball is\nnoted within the rectal vault, with the intrapelvic bowel\nappearing otherwise unremarkable. Contrast is noted within the\nbladder from prior procedure.\nBONE WINDOWS: No malignant-appearing osseous lesions are\nidentified.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No significant retroperitoneal or subcapsular hematoma\nidentified. While the amount of intra-abdominal/pelvic ascites\nhas significantly decreased from prior [**2173-9-22**] exam\nthe fluid is of slightly higher density suggesting that it is a\nmixture of underlying ascites and blood likely related to oozing\nfrom capsular puncture during TIPS attempt.\n2. Abnormal appearance to the inferior right hepatic lobe\nparenchyma distal to site of known embolization. This may\nreflect underlying parenchyma infarction.\n3. Persistent corticomedullary differentiation of the kidneys\nwith contrast within the collecting systems. This suggests\nunderlying contrast-induced nephropathy/ATN and should be\ncorrelated with serial creatinine values.\n4. Interval decrease in size to now moderate right pleural\neffusion which is also of slightly higher density than before\nand may have a component of blood within it. A very small\nanterior right pneumothorax is also noted, not unexpected given\nthe recent pleural catheter removal.\n.\n.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient is a 64 year old male with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b\nportal hypertension, ascites, and varices who presented as a\ntransfer from OSH for TIPS evaluation.  He has had two failed\nTIPS placement attempts with hepatic artery puncture on the\nsecond attempt.\n.\n# TIPS Placement Attempts:  He was sent from OSH for TIPS\nevaluation and placement.  CXR, echocardiogram, and duplex US of\nliver were completed and no contraindication to the procedure\nwas identified on this imaging.  Viral and autoimmune hepatitis\nassays were negative.  Imaging from the OSH was uploaded and\nreviewed by IR.  TIPS placement was attempted on [**2173-10-8**], but\nthe shunt could not be passed through his liver tissue.  He had\na second attempt on [**2173-10-11**], which was also not successful.  The\nhepatic artery was punctured during the procedure and repaired\nwithout blood loss or significant hemodynamic instability.  He\nhad a brief stay in the MICU and returned to the floor.  His\ntransaminases were significantly elevated after the second\nprocedure, but were trending down rapidly at the time of\ndischarge.  Per IR, further TIPS placement attempts would be\ntechnically possible, but will be deferred until a later time.\n.\n# Creatinine Elevation: His Cr increased to 1.3 after his second\nTIPS attempt.  CT scan on [**2173-10-12**] showed findings concerning for\ncontrast-induced nephropathy/ATN.  His Cr remained stable at 1.3\nfor the last three days.  A prerenal etiology may also have been\ncontributing given his limited PO intake and recent fluid\nlosses.  He will likely need aggressive hydration and\nAcetylcysteine with any future contrast loads.\n.\n# Pain Control: He has significant pain from immobility due to\n[**Last Name (un) 4584**]-[**Location (un) **] Syndrome, which was made worse by chest tube\nplacement during his first TIPS attempt.  He was much more\ncomfortable after the chest tube was removed.  He was started on\nOxycodone 5 mg PO with close monitoring.  He did not show any\nsigns of hepatic encephalopathy or sedation.  He was switched to\nQ6H PRN dosing on [**2173-10-13**], which worked well for the patient.\n.\n# Hydrothorax: He has a history of recurrent hepatic\nhydrothorax.  His CXR on admission showed a large pleural\neffusion / hydrothorax with complete whiteout of the right\nhemithorax.  He was asymptomatic and maintaining good oxygen\nsaturation.  He had thoracentesis with removal of 2 L of fluid.\nHe tolerated the procedure well, with only some mild coughing.\nThe fluid was transudative based on Light's criteria, with no\nevidence of infection.  During his TIPS procedure on [**2173-10-8**], he\nhad 3.5 L of fluid drained and a chest tube was placed.  The\nchest tube drained large amounts of fluid over the days\nfollowing its placement.  The chest tube was removed at the time\nof his repeat TIPS attempt on [**2173-10-11**].  Patient has oxygen\nsaturation 98% on room air at time of discharge.\n.\n# Ascites: His outpatient hepatologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] for more\ninformation regarding his prior diuresis, recurrent ascites, and\nhydrothorax.  He was previously taking Furosemide and\nSpironolactone, but developed hypotension with use of the\ndiuretics and continued to have significant hydrothorax and\nrecurrent ascites requiring large volume paracentesis.  During\nhis stay at [**Hospital1 18**], he was kept on a low sodium diet and fluid\nrestriction of 1500 ml.  Strict I/Os and daily weights were\nmonitored.  He did not require additional paracentesis after 4 L\nof fluid were removed during his first TIPS attempt.\n.\n# Alcholic Cirrhosis: The indications for TIPS include recurrent\nascites, hepatic hydrothorax, or variceal bleeding.  His MELD\nscore on admission was 11, so TIPS was not contraindicated.  He\ndenied any prior episodes of hepatic encephalopathy or GI\nbleeding.  He was continued on a regimen of Lactulose and\nRifaximin.  His Rifaximin dosing was changed to 400 mg TID so\nthat he could take smaller pills.  MELD labs were checked daily\nand his score remained stable around 11, but acutely increased\nto 15 after his second TIPS attempt.\n.\n# Nutrition: On admission he appeared cachectic and chronically\nill, reporting a significant weight loss over the last few\nmonths.  His PO intake was poor during his admission.  Nutrition\nconsult felt that he would clearly benefit from additional\nnutrition through tube feeds.  A Dobhoff tube was placed on\n[**2173-10-15**] and tube feeds were initiated.  Nutrition recommended\nNutren 2.0 at 70 ml/hr.  Continued PO intake was encouraged and\nhe was provided Ensure and Beneprotein supplements with each\nmeal.\n.\n# Hypotension: He has a history of symptomatic hypotension.  His\nTSH was mildly elevated at 7.8 and his morning cortisol was 8.3,\nwhich is WNL but on the low side.  He will need followup of his\nTSH as an outpatient.  Further workup of his cortisol level is\nprobably not necessary at this time.  He remained\nhemodynamically stable with SBP in the 90s to 100s after\nadmission mild diuretic treatments, paracentesis, and\nthoracentesis.  Diuretic treatment was discontinued pending\nTIPS.  He was given Albumin (5%) 25 g on several occasions for\nvolume repletion.\n.\n# [**Last Name (un) 4584**]-[**Location (un) **] Syndrome: He had an episode of GBS in [**2169**] which\nresolved and a second episode which started several months ago.\nHe is currently wheelchair bound due to LE weakness.  He was\nseen by PT and was able to stand with a walker but not ambulate.\n He will require additional PT after discharge.\n.\n# Anemia:  He has a slightly macrocytic anemia with a hematocrit\nstable around 30.  His WBC count and platelets are also low,\nsuggesting a component of marrow suppression.  Iron studies show\nan moderately elevated ferritin, low TIBC, and low serum iron\nconsistent with chronic inflammation.  His B12 and folate levels\nwere normal.  His hematocrit was monitored closely, and he\nshowed no signs of GI bleeding.\n.\n# DVT Prophylaxis: Provided with Heparin 5000 units SC TID.\n.\n# MICU Course [**2173-4-8**]:\nPatient was admitted to the MICU after puncture of hepatic\nartery during TIPS procedure for hemodynamic monitoring. Patient\nremained stable and serial hematocrits were stable. A CT scan\nwas completed showing: No significant hematoma, with decreased\nascites, with some blood mixed in (likely oozing from the TIPS\nprocedure attempts). It also demonstrated possible kidney damage\nsecondary to contrast nephropathy so patient's creatinine needs\nto be monitored clinically.  Patient was transferred back to the\nfloor after 24 hour monitoring.\n.\n# Followup:\n-- Appointment scheduled in 2 weeks with Dr [**Name (NI) **] to begin\ntransplant evaluation process\n-- Pending results:  CA [**82**]-9 and Vitamin D assays\n\nMedications on Admission:\nHome Medications:\nHeparin 5,000 units daily\nLactinex 1 packet [**Hospital1 **]\nLactulose 30 ml TID\nLorazepam 1 mg QHS\nLorazepam PRN\nColace 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]\nSenna\nLactobacillus\nMVI daily\n.\nDischarge Medications:\nMorphine Sulfate 2 mg Q6H PRN\nHeparin SC 5,000 units [**Hospital1 **]\nLactulose 30 ml TID\nRifaxamin 400 mg [**Hospital1 **]\nNasal Spray 1 spray each nostril TID\nLorazepam 2 mg Q6H PRN\nLorazepam 1 mg QHS\nColace 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]\nSenna 2 tabs QHS\nLactobacillus 1 mg PO BID\nMVI daily\n.\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO TID (3\ntimes a day): Titrate to [**3-11**] bowel movements per day.\n2. rifaximin 200 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO TID (3 times a\nday).\n3. lidocaine 5 %(700 mg/patch) Adhesive Patch, Medicated Sig:\nOne (1) Adhesive Patch, Medicated Topical DAILY (Daily): 12\nhours on, 12 hours off.\n4. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\n5. bisacodyl 5 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
