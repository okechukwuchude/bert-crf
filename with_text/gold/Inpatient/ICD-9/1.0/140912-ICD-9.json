The left ventricular cavity size is\nnormal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal\n(LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall\nmotion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There\nare complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.\nThe aortic valve is abnormal with a coaptation defect between\nthe right and left cusps seen best in long axis view, there is\nquestion of leaftlet perforation. Severe (4+) aortic\nregurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is\neccentric. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with\ntrivial mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**2194-8-18**] at\n0930.\nPostbypass:\nThere is a well seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic\nposition with no perivalvular leak. There is no evidence of\naortic dissection. Estimated left ventricular function is\nunchanged from prebypass.\n\nRadiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2194-8-20**]\n10:21 AM\nFinal Report: In comparison with the study of earlier in this\ndate, the right chest tube has been removed.

He was evaluated by cardiac\nsurgery for an aortic valve replacement and underwent a\npre-operative work-up including teeth extractions. The patient\nwas brought to the Operating Room on [**2194-8-18**] where the patient\nunderwent tissue aortic valve replacement (#23mm tissue).  The\npatient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was\ntransferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and\ninvasive monitoring.\nThe patient remained stable in the immediate post-op period.\nAnesthesia was reversed, the patient was neurologically intact\nand he weaned from the ventilator and extubated. Over the next\nseveral hours he weaned from vasopressor support. On POD1 Beta\nblockers were initiated and he was started on diuretics and\ngently diuresed toward his preoperative weight.  On POD1 the\npatient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further\nrecovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued per\ncardiac surgery protocol without complication.  The patient was\nevaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with\nstrength and mobility.  Per infectious disease service it was\nrecommended that he be discharged to home on a 2 week course of\nceftriaxone pending the results of his culture data. He declined\nthe recommendation from the infectious diseae service for IVAB\nhowever, did agree to a 7 day course of po levoflox. The\ninfectious disease service will contact Mr. [**Known lastname 30123**] [**Last Name (Titles) 30124**] he\nfinal results of his culture data. At teh time of discharge\nthere was no growth from the cultures taken and he was afebrile\nwith WBC 9.\nThe remainder of his hospital course was uneventful, by the time\nof discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the\nwound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.\nThe patient was discharged home with VNA in good condition with\nappropriate follow up instructions.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nPreadmission medications listed are correct and complete.\nInformation was obtained from PatientwebOMR.\n1.
