      "text": "Chief Complaint:  BRBPR/Melena\n   HPI:\n   Patient is a 48 yo M with a hx of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented to\n   [**Hospital 869**] hospital on [**4-30**] with a c/o abd pain.  Per OSH records, he\n   originally was dx with liver failure in [**3-10**] after presenting with\n   acute hepatitis in the setting of recent heavy tylenol use in\n   conjunction with chronic EtOH use.  Since that time, he was admitted in\n   [**2200-4-11**] for SBP during which time his hospital course was complicated\n   by E.coli sepsis from presumed gallbladder source due to a\n   non-visualized gallbladder on HIDA scan as well as persistently rising\n   tbili.  Eventually during that admission an ERCP was performed on\n   [**2200-3-31**] with biliary stent placement with good biliary flow\n   post-procedures, but this did not resolve the patients rising\n   bilirubin.  An AFP was negative.  He was discharged on [**4-19**] from the\n   OSH with a 2 week course of augmentin after having been treated inpt\n   with zosyn.  Additionally, the patients creatinine was found to be 2.1\n   on admission and he was eventually discharged with a cr of 1.6, where\n   records indicate that he had had a cr of 0.9 in [**3-10**] and then by mid\n   [**Month (only) 1530**] had a cr of 2.3.\n   He was then readmitted on [**4-30**] to [**Hospital 869**] hospital again with a c/o abd\n   pain.  Work-up was significant for a tbili of 31, WBC of 14, Cr 3.  A\n   diagnostic paracentesis was performed and was negative for SBP (WBC 60,\n   RBC 790 PMN 23 GLC 168 [**Doctor First Name **] 22 ALB <1).  The decision was made to\n   transfer the patient to [**Hospital1 5**] for eval of liver failure for possible\n   transplantation eval.  Of note per records, his bilirubin level was\n   twice that seen on his previous admission.\n   .\n   Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 5**] VS:  97.9 95/50 88 16 100%RA.  On the floor, an\n   abdominal US showed probable patency of the extrahepatic portion of the\n   main portal vein. Likely slow flow within the intrahepatic portal veins\n   as well as a mildly distended gallbladder in the setting of large\n   volume abdominal ascites.  For his renal failure, lasix/spirinolactone\n   was being held and pt was receiving albumin challenge to assess for\n   HRS.\n   .\n   At 4PM on [**5-4**], pt had an episode of shaking chills.  VS at the time\n   were:  97.9, 110/68, 89, 18, 100RA.  Pt subsequently spiked a temp to\n   102.1, became tachycardic to 130, and hypotensive to 91/53.  After 500\n   cc bolus, BP increased to 119/68.  During this time, pt also had 2\n   large bloody bowel movements.

Limited assessment of the portal vein. Probable patency of\nthe\nextrahepatic portion of the main portal vein. Likely slow flow\nwithin the\nintrahepatic portal veins. However, partial occlusion cannot be\ncompletely\nexcluded and this could be further assessed by non-contrast MRI\nof the liver (given the patient's renal insufficiency).\n2. Mildly distended gallbladder in the setting of large volume\nabdominal\nascites. Correlation with clinical suspicion for acute\ncholecystitis is\nrecommended. A HIDA scan could be performed if clinically\nindicated.\n3. Splenomegaly.\n4. No hydronephrosis.\n5. Large volume ascites.\n.\nCT A/P [**5-5**]:\nIMPRESSION: Fecalized ileal small bowel with mild proximal\ndilation\nmay represents partial small bowel obstruction. There is no\npneumatosis or\nwall thickening, however the indistinct wall of the fecalized\nbowel loops is concerning for ischemia, although not specific.\nThere is no evidence of\nperforation or abscess.\n.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nIn short, Mr [**Known lastname 33681**] is a 48M w alcoholic cirrhosis who\noriginally p/w abdominal pain to an OSH on [**4-30**], was found to\nhave tbili of 31, WBC of 14, Cr 3. A diagnostic paracentesis was\nperformed and was negative for SBP (WBC 60, RBC 790 PMN 23 GLC\n168 [**Doctor First Name 674**] 22 ALB <1). The decision was made to transfer the\npatient to [**Hospital1 18**] for eval of liver failure for possible\ntransplantation eval. On the floor, an abdominal US showed\nprobable patency of the extrahepatic portion of the main portal\nvein. Likely slow flow within the intrahepatic portal veins as\nwell as a mildly distended gallbladder in the setting of large\nvolume abdominal ascites. For his renal failure,\nlasix/spiranolactone was being held and pt was receiving albumin\nchallenge to assess for HRS.  On [**5-4**], pt had an episode of\nshaking chills, which was followed by fever to 102.1,\ntachycardia, hypotension, and large bloody BM. Pt was started on\nfluids, vanc/zosyn and transferred to the MICU for sepsis,\nlikely complicated by DIC. In the MICU, paracentesis revealed\nSBP, blood cultures grew GNRs. Pt was started on pressors,\ncipro/metronidazole were added, however, the pt became\nsuccessively more acidotic. Family discussion took place, pt was\nswitched to CMO and died soon afterward.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMetRONIDAZOLE (FLagyl) 500 mg IV Q8H Order date: [**5-5**] @ 0742\nAcetaminophen 325-650 mg PO Q6H:PRN fever, pain\nPantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H\nPiperacillin-Tazobactam Na 2.25 g IV Q6H\nAlbumin 25% (12.5g / 50mL) 50 g IV BID\nCiprofloxacin 400 mg IV Q24H\nVancomycin 1000 mg IV Q 24H Day 1: 4/5/9\nSSI\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\nexpired\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary:\nBacterial Peritonitis\n\nSecondary:\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nPatient expired.\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nPatient expired.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nexpired\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2200-5-7**]"

Per OSH records, pt\n   with recent nml colonoscopy.  EGD from OSH with report of portal\n   gastropathy and esophageal candidiasis.  Source of bloody stool likely\n   from upper source.

Pt has been evaluated at [**Hospital1 5**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**]\n   [**4-7**] for possible transplant, complicated by lack of insurance, history\n   of alcohol use as recent as [**3-10**].

His tbili\n   is marginally elevated compared to his baseline of 28 earlier this\n   month.  More concerning is his progressively rising creatinine.\n   Abdominal U/S on [**5-3**] showed no intra/extra bil dil, probable portal\n   venous flow.\n   - consider CT abd/pelvis r/o infection\n   - plan possible MRI to eval portal vein.\n   - continue lactulose QID given mild confusion, titrate up prn.\n   - hold off on lasix/spirinolactone given ARF and hyponatremia.\n   - given worsening status with elevated WBC and new fever, will perform\n   dx paracentesis\n   - GI consult to perform EGD/flex sig\n   - obtain OSH colonoscopy results.\n   - nutrition consult.\n   - consider vitamin K repletion.\n   .\n   # ARF - per OMR, creatinine 0.9 on [**2200-3-24**], up to 2.1 during [**4-11**] OSH\n   admission for SBP and then d/c with Cr 1.6, felt [**3-3**] pre-renal from\n   cirrhosis. Up to 2.5 upon admission to OSH [**4-30**], and 3.3 on admit at\n   [**Hospital1 5**]. Most concerning for HRS, though ddx also includes pre-renal, AIN\n   (recent course of augmentin and zosyn for SBP and E. Coli bacteremia).\n   U/S abd to eval kidneys without hydro/stones/masses.

On MICU transfer, pt\n   encephalopathic with +asterixis, likely contribution from hepatic\n   dysfunction and uremia.\n   - continue lactulose as above.\n   - if fails to improve, consider renal consult.\n   .\n   # Hyponatremia - Resolved from admit.  Likely [**3-3**] liver disease.\n   - hold diuretics, free water restrict, and trend.\n   .\n   # Acidosis - Gap 11 on admit, likely [**3-3**] ARF, though could have\n   contribution from alcoholic or starvation ketosis.  On transfer to\n   MICU, gap 23, likely related to lactic acidosis\n   - check ABG, lactate.\n   - trend HCO3.\n   .\n   # Anemia - macrocytic, HCT 38.2 in [**3-10**], down to 30 on [**4-30**]. LDH not\n   elevated arguing against hemolysis, as does low indirect bilirubin. pt\n   denies blood in stools or hemetemesis.\n   - guaic stools.\n   - maintain t&c.\n   - check iron studies to evaluate for ACD and pt's h/o\n   ?hemochromotosis.\n   .\n   #DM2:\n   - HISS\n   .\n   FEN:  NPO for now with encephalopathy\n   Prophylaxis:  Pneumoboots, PPI, Lactulose\n   ACCESS: PIVs, a-line\n   CODE: FULL.\n   .\n   # COMM: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5579**] (h) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5580**], (c) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5581**], (w)\n   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5582**].\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition:\n   Glycemic Control:\n   Lines:\n   20 Gauge - [**2200-5-4**] 10:01 PM\n   Arterial Line - [**2200-5-5**] 12:35 AM\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT:\n   Stress ulcer:\n   VAP:\n   Comments:\n   Communication:  Comments:\n   Code status:\n   Disposition:\n"
