Patient was\nscheduled to have an outpatient stress test the day prior to\nadmission, but was unbale to participate in the study and\nreturned to his nursing home.  Later the same evening he\ndeveloped acute SOB and was take to [**Hospital3 **] where he\nwas found to be having an STEMI. Cardiac catheterization\nrevealed severe three vessel disease with 100% occluded LAD, 90%\nLCx lesion and severe RCA disease requiring BMS x3. He required\nintubation during cardiac catheterization for respiratory\nfailure and subsequently required pressor support with\nperipheral dopamine for cardiogenic shock. He is now extubated\nbut continues to require dopamine to maintain a SBP in the\n80s-90s.\n.\n On arrival his vital signs were HR 114 with BP 94/71.

Lung volumes are quite low, making evaluation of the\nlungs difficult. There are multiple bilateral rib fractures. I\nsee no pneumothorax.\n\nTTE [**2158-8-5**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal\ndefect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric\nleft ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is\nmildly dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is\nseverely depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %) with global hypokinesis and\ndistal LV/apical akinesis to dyskinesis. No masses or thrombi\nare seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal\ndefect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe\nglobal free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the\nsinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve\nleaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not\npresent. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve\nleaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve\nprolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid\nvalve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\n\nR foot X ray: [**2158-8-10**]\nLarge ulcer extending to the calcaneal tuberosity\nposteroinferiorly without gross cortical destruction. If the\nulcer probes the bone this would be highly suspicious for\nosteomyelitis.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nPrimary Reason for Hospitalization:\n57M w/ HTN, DM, HLD, PVD and ESRD on HD presented to OSH with\ninferior STEMI s/p PCI to RCA now transfered for further care.\n\nActive Issues:\n# Cardiogenic Shock: Patient required pressor support with\ndopamine following PCI at OSH and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] at a\ndose of 8mg/kg/min.  On HD6 patient was successfully weaned from\ndopamine and was maintaining a stable blood pressure.  He\nmaintained pressures through dialysis as well.  He was restarted\non his home anti-hypertensives prior to discharge.\n\n# CAD:  Patient did not have prior history of known CAD, but\nrecent TTE from [**5-/2158**] revealed anterolateral and apical defects\nconsistent with CAD. Patient presented on [**8-1**] with RCA infarct\nthat required BMS x3. Cardiac cath also revealed 90% LCx disease\nand completely occluded LAD that was presumed chronic. LV gram\nrevealed LVEF of 20%.  On HD3 patient was taken to the cath lab\nand had successful stenting of his left circumflex.  He was\ncontinued on plavix and aspirin throughout admission.\n\n# ESRD on HD: Patient receives chronic HD on MWF schedule.\nPatient's electrolytes were monitored closely throughout\nadmission.  Patient was dialyzed on his normal schedule and\npressures tolerated this without issue.  He refused many of his\nmedications throughout admission.\n\n#Bacteremia: Patient had one blood culture positive for gram\npositive cocci, MSSA.  He was treated with IV vancomycin given\npenicillin allergy.  Patient will be treated for 10 day course,\nlast day [**2158-8-15**].  A PICC line was placed for IV administration\nfollowing discharge.  Patient was afebrile and hemodynamically\nstable at the time of discharge.  He had two days of\nsurveillance cultures with no growth to date at the time of\ndischarge.\n\n#Atrial fibrillation: Patient had an episode of atrial\nfibrillation during his catheterization.  He was given\namiodarone, and spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm.  He\nagain had an episode of atrial fibrillation on HD5 and was\nstarted on an amiodarone drip.  He spontaneously converted into\nsinus rhythm again, later the same day.  He was started on oral\namiodarone with a goal loading dose of 8g.  At the time of\ndischarge, his dose was 300mg po BID.  He will continue this for\n11 days, ending [**2158-8-21**].  At that time, he should be\ntransitioned to amiodarone 200mg po daily.  Despite CHADS2 score\nof 3, patient was felt to be a poor candidate for\nanticoagulation given poor medication compliance and fall risk.\nPatient was in sinus rhythm and hemodynamically stable at the\ntime of discharge.\n\n# HTN: Patient was in cardiogenic shock at the time of\nadmission, therefore his home anti-hypertensives were held.\nSince BPs were still lowish at discharge norvasc was\ndiscontinued and valsartan was continued but at a much lower\ndose (40mg [**Hospital1 **]).\n\n# HLD: Patient is s/p STEMI. He was changed to 40mg po\natorvastatin daily as he is also on amiodarone, and therefore\nwas felt to not necessitate 80mg daily.\n\n# Right heel ulcer: Patient had a 2x4 cm ulcer on right heel\nconsistent with arterial insufficiency. Per report, this has\nbeen followed by vascular surgery as an outpatient.  Patient was\nevaluated by both vascular surgery and podiatry.  Both teams\nagreed that the ulcer was not actively infected, and therefore\nthere was no indication for antibiotics.  The ulcer was cleaned\ndaily with application of Santil ointment.  An xray of the heel\nwas performed showing an ulcer but no cortical destruction.  Per\nvascular surgery, the patient should have an ABI checked as an\noutpatient.\n\n# Bilateral hearing loss: Patient reported acute hearing deficit\ncoinciding with his myocardial infarction. No obstructive cause\nwas apparent on otoscopic examination. Hearing loss appeared to\nbe symmetric. He was not given otoxic drugs. Ischemia in the\nsetting of cardiogenic shock is also a possiblity. Symptoms were\nnot consistent with CVA causing hearing loss, as he had no\nassociated symptoms of nystagmus, nausea or dizziness as would\nbe expected.  Patient's hearing improved spontaneously.  He\nshould have ENT follow-up as an outpatient if he continues to\nhave further issues.\n\n# Compliance: Patient refused many medications throughout\nadmission, which made regulation of blood sugar and electrolytes\ndifficult.
