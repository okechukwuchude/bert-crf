The patient\nand her daughters report that she has had decreased PO intake\nover the past week, and yesterday developed nausea and vomiting.\nHer daughters further state that she was admitted to NEBH one\nmonth prior for \"dehydration,\" but she did not have a low\nsodiuum level at that time. They further state that since her\ndischarge, she has had an acute decline in her memory and\nability to function independently, and is currently living at\nhome with her husband under 24 hour nursing care.  She denies\nany f/c/s, diarrhea, chest pain, shortness of breath, HA,\npalpitations, orthopnea, LE edema, or PND. The patient does\nreport a periumbilicar abomdinal pain, which her daughters state\nhas been going on for years.  Her daughters also state that she\nhas had no recent medication changes.\n.\nIn the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 77 115/55 20 100%RA.  A CXR and UA\nwas negative. A CTAP demonstrated a 7 mm celiac aneurysm, for\nwhich vascular surgery was consulted in the ED with\nrecommendation for no acute intervention at this time.

Her thiazide diuretic\nwas held, as this was likely contributing to hyponatremia.  On\nadmission, she was noted to be hypovolemic and her sodium\nimproved some with normal saline.  However, her sodium started\nto decrease with continued normal saline infusion.  Urine and\nserum lytes were rechecked and in the setting of euvolemia, her\nhyponatremia was thought most likely to be due to SIADH (urine\nosm >400, serum Na <120 and serum osms low, and urine Na\ninappropriately high).  CT head and chest were done to eval for\nmalignancy for etiology of SIADH, no masses were noted.  She was\ntreated with free water restriction and TID salt tabs, as\nrecommended by the nephrology service.  On discharge she will\ncontinue to take salt tabs and have her Na monitored as an\noutpatient.  Na on discharge 132.  She will f/u with PCP for\nanother [**Name9 (PRE) **] check on [**12-7**].  She should probably not restart a\nthiazide diuretic in the future.\n\n#Altered mental status: likely has baseline dementia that\ninitially was slowly progressing but acutely worsened after\nbeing hospitalized in [**Month (only) **].  Has 24 hr nursing care at home.\n During admission initially, was frequently not oriented to\nplace or location, or why she was in the hospital and often saw\npeople and things that were not actually present, with both\nauditory and visual hallucinations.  Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] course\nsuggested delirium in the setting of her hyponatremia vs\nworsening dementia.  On discharge, mental status at baseline per\nfamily, unable to do months of the year backwards but AOx3 and\nno hallucinations.  continued home aricept.\n\n# HTN: Her hydrochlorothiazide was held as above.  She was\ncontinued on valsartan at 160 mg [**Hospital1 **], which is her home dose.\nShe was also continued on isosorbide mononitrate.  SBP was still\nelevated to 140s-160s, so amlodipine 5 mg daliy was started for\nimproved BP control.\n\n# ?Celiac aneurysm: Initially CT Abd/pelvis showed concern for\nceliac artery aneursym, however final CTA read ectatic celiac\nartery without aneurysm.\n\n# Elevated lipase: Unclear significance with no radiographic\nevidence of pancreatic and benign abdominal exam.  Also had CTA\nabd/pelvis without evidence of pancreatitis.\n\n# CAD s/p PCI: She was continued on ASA, valsartan, and\nclopidogrel.\n\n# DM 2: HISS with accuchecks, continued home metformin on\ndischarge.\n\n# HLD: Vytorin continued on discharge.\n\nCode: DNR/DNI (confirmed with daughters/[**Name2 (NI) **]-HCPs during admission\n\nContact: [**Name (NI) 107386**],[**First Name3 (LF) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 107387**]\n\nMedications on Admission:\nClonidine 0.15 mg po bid\nASA 325 mg daily\nMVI\nxalatan eye drops\nValsartan 320 mg daily\nClopidogrel 75 mg daily\nVytorin daily\nCa/Vit D\nOmeprazole\nAricept 10 mg daily\nMOM\nFosamax 35 mg weekly\nMetformin 850 mg po bid\nHCTZ 25 mg daily\nImdur 60 mg daily\nSL NTG PRN\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)

This means limiting the intake\nof plain water, juice, tea, and other fluids like this to one\nliter per day.  Liquids such as gatorade, soup, supplement\nshakes, and others that have a higher content of salt and\nelectrolytes are not limited.  Please continue limiting free\nwater to 1 liter per day unless directed otherwise by your PCP,\n[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
