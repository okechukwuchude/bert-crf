Attempt at treatment with early ERCP failed\n   [**3-13**] ampulla positioning within a diverticulum. CBD visualization was\n   not pursued because of the high risk of perforation with\n   sphincterotomy, also peri-procedure development of A-fib with RVR. Pt\n   now may have post-ERCP pancreatitis as well, given lipase bump to\n   1200s. Apache II score: 7, corresponding to a 7.6% mortality. Will\n   require repeat ERCP, given obstructive picture (elevated LFTs, CBD\n   measuring 11mm on US), GNR bacteremia, concern for evolving biliary\n   sepsis.\n   -NPO for bowel rest, plus expected ERCP and cholecystectomy\n   -IV morphine (2-4mg Q6H PRN) for pain control\n   -IVF (1L NS @ 150cc/hr) for fluid resuscitation\n   -ERCP tomorrow, per GI\n   -Cholecystectomy prior to hospital discharge\n   #) Biliary infection: Pt presented initially with fever and RUQ pain\n   [**3-13**] cholecystitis, diagnosed by RUQ ultrasound. Following a TBili bump\n   to 5.3 the following day, the picture became concerning for cholangitis\n   (class triad = fever, RUQ pain, jaundice), though pt was no longer\n   febrile. GNR+ bacteremia may be [**3-13**] to this infection. The predisposing\n   source is presumably biliary obstruction [**3-13**] biliary calculi. Concern\n   is for biliary sepsis.\n   -Unasyn (Ampicillin-Sulbactam 1.5 g IV Q6H)\n   -Coinsider ciprofloxacin (Ciprofloxacin HCl 500 mg PO/NG Q12H) for\n   additional GNR coverage\n   -ERCP for re-establishment of biliary drainage\n   #) SIRS/Hypotension: Resolving. Over past two days, pt has been febrile\n   to 103, hypotensive, with a bandemia and a clear infectious source: the\n   biliary tree. However, pt presented to [**Hospital1 5**] ED with transient\n   hypotension that resolved without fluid resuscitation. Most likely\n   explanation for patient's hypotension in our ED is the diltiazem\n   administered for A-fib w/ RVR, though given the GNR bacteremia, plus\n   unresolved gallstone pancreatitis +/- cholangitis, concern for sepsis\n   remains high.\n   -Unasyn and Cipro for broad-spectrum coverage, as above\n   -Monitor HR, BP, UOP\n   #) A-fib with RVR: Paroxysmal A-fib. Most likely etiology is systemic\n   infection. Though pt has reported hx of CHF, there are no signs of\n   volume overload on exam or CXR. Rate conrol achieved with diltiazem\n   prior to arrival on floor. Pt spontaneously converted to NSR. CHADS\n   score of 3 (for CHF, HTN, DM), therefore anticoagulation technically\n   indicated, though would wait to establish recurrence before treating.\n   -Continue Diltiazem 30mg PO daily for rate control\n   #) Troponin leak: Tn was 0.55 at OSH, 0.07 on admission here. Per\n   report, pt's Tn has been similarly elevated in the past. EKG normal in\n   ED. No prior.\n   -Cycle enzymes\n   -Repeat EKG\n   #) HTN: Pt treated with lisinopril and HCTZ at home. Currently\n   normotensive on floor.\n   -Hold home antihypertensives in setting of recent hypotension\n   -Anti-HTN support provided by diltiazem\n   #) Asthma: Stable.

She was sent to the [**Hospital1 3494**] ED\nwhere she received diltiazem 10 mg IV boluses x 2 and then was\nstarted on a diltiazem drip.\n.\nIn the ED, initial vital signs were HR of 80 on diltiazem drip\nat 10 mg/hour, BP 96/46, RR 18, 99% on 2l NC. She was given\nunasyn for treatment of cholecystitis. She was given morphine\nfor abdominal pain that she states is similar to prior episodes\nof pancreatitis. She was given diltiazem 30 mg PO and diltiazem\ndrip was stopped as patient was in NSR.

There is mild symmetric left\nventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is\nnormal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF\n70-80%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left\nventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are focal\ncalcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)\nare mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral\nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The left\nventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There\nis mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year old female with HTN, diastolic CHF,\nasthma, admitted to OSH with GNR bacteremia with cholesytitis,\ncholangitis, and gallstone pancreatitis, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]\nfollowing unsuccessful ERCP complicated by A. fib with RVR.\n\n1. GNR bacteremia. Likely source of GNR bacteremia is\ncholecysitis/cholangitis. Patient's BP remained stable though\npatient was initially tachcyardic in setting of A. fib with RVR,\nnow resolved with diltiazem. Cultures done at OSH revealed\nE.coli sensitive to Cipro & Unsasyn. She was continued on Unasyn\nand Cipro for double GN coverage. Surgery co-managed this\npatient, who underwent successful ERCP on [**2114-4-17**] during which a\ngallstone was removed, resolving biliary obstruction. On [**2114-4-19**]\npatient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Post surgery\npatient's WBC was within normal range, patient was afebrile. She\nwas discharged home without any antibiotic coverage.\n.\n2. Cholecystitis/Cholangitis. Patient admitted to OSH with\nelevated LFTs, abdominal pain, and [**Name (NI) 5283**] sono consistent with\ncholecystitis. Given that LFTs were consistent with an\nobstructive picture, an ERCP was performed on [**2114-4-17**]. Source of\nGNR bacteremia was thought to be from a biliary source. The\npatient was continued on antibiotics as above, and was\ntransferred to surgery once stable for further management. On\n[**2114-4-19**] patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Surgery\nwas done without complications. Post surgery patient was\ncontinue on antibiotics. WBC was normal.\n.\n3. Pancreatitis. Likely sedcondary to gallstone pancreatitis.\nShe was initially hydrated with IVFs, kept NPO, and her pain\nmanaged with morphine. Her lipase was downtrending. On [**2114-4-19**]\npatient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Surgery was done\nwithout complications. Post surgery patient's diet was advanced\nslowly to regular/diabetic, patient tolerated diet well.\nPatient's liver enzymes were normal prior disharge, her lipase\nwas slightly elevated.\n.\n4. A. fib with RVR. Paroxysmal and recurrent. Pt reports [**3-14**] yrs\nof palpitations. Developed A.fib with RVR in setting of\nprocedure, which resolved initially after diltiazem drip and\ncontinuation on diltiazem 30 PO [**Month/Day (3) **] but returned x5hrs on floor,\nwith spontaneous return to SR. Given patient's CHADS score of 3,\nshe may be a candidate for anticoagulation and should be\nscheduled with PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] to discuss this further. With\nDiltiazem 30mg PO [**Name9 (PRE) **] patient heart rate continue to be sinus\nrhythm with occasional PACs. Patient was started on Aspirin 325\nmg PO QDay and her Diltiazem was converted to Diltiazem ER 240mg\nPO qday per cardiology recommendation. Patient will have a\nfollow up with cardiologist on [**2114-6-4**] regarding further A-fib\nmanagement.\n.\n5. HTN.  Anti-hypertensives were held in the setting of\ncholangitis/cholecystitis. Patient's BP was closly monitored\nduring hospital stay and her SBP was 120s-150s. Patient was\ninstructed to restart all her home anti-hypertensive medication\nafter discharge and follow up with her PCP for further\nmanagement.\n.\n6. Asthma.  Continued home advair, and given prn nebs.\n.\n7. Diabetes.  Kept on HISS and monitored fingersticks. On\ndischarge was started on Diabetic Diet with low carbohydrates.\nShe did not require exogenous insulin at discharge.\n.\n8. Diastolic CHF. Cardiomegaly on CXR. Echo demonstrated\nelevated LV filling pressures with preserved EF (70-80%) and no\nwall motion abnormalities. Per patient, she was told she had a\n\"large heart\" following her first pregnancy at age 26. During\nhospitalization patient didn't demonstrate any symptoms of CHF\nexacerbation. Lung x-ray was grossly normal, patient has trace\nlower extremities edema. Patient denies SOB or DOE. Patient will\nfollow-up with cardiology as an outpatient.\n.\nAt the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile\nwith stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a diabetic\nregular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain\nwas well controlled.  She was discharged with VNA services.
