Of note, pt was here recently for same presentation\nand had ENT scope that was unrevealing.  On that occasion, he\nwas admitted to the ICU and required intubation, was evaluated\nby ENT who visulaized a small amount of tissue overlying the\nvocal cords with no evidence of obstruction to level of\nepiglottis, however not able to view larynx.\n.\nIn the ED, initial vs were not recorded, however pt was reported\nto be hypoxic. Patient was given heliox, albuterol, ipratroprium\nand 125 mg methylprednisolone.  Initially he was anxious and\nvery stridorous but subesequently relaxed and was breathing more\ncomfortably, although still with insp stridor.  Labs were\nnotable for hyponatremia to the 120s, mild anemia.  CT neck was\nattempted but was unable to be completed because the patient was\nunable to lie down.  Chest xray showed no acute CP process.  EKG\nshowed NSR with occ PACs.  Vitals on transfer were 108/70 94 24\n100% on non-rebreather.\n.\nOn the floor, pt continues to be stridorous and is difficulty to\nunderstand due to mask/heliox.

Simple fluid lining the posterior [**Last Name (un) **]-, oro-, and\nlaryngopharynx, and\nanterior laryngopharynx, findings likely secondary to recent\nintubation. No compressive extrinsic enhancing mass lesion to\nexplain patient's stridor. However, assessment for endoluminal\nlesions or abnormalities is limited due to intubation. Follwoup\nas clinically indicated.\n3. Endotracheal tube in standard position, 3.3 cm above the\ncarina.\n4. Mild paraseptal emphysema in the lung apices.\n5. Stable degenerative changes of the cervical spine.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n78 yo gentleman with hx of MICU admission for stridor with no\nevidence of obstruction, now presenting with recurrent stridor.\n.\n#. Stridor: Initially unclear cause of his stridor given normal\nlaryngoscope on last visit. Pt intubated on admission and\nstabilized on vent. CT scan of the neck did not show any\nextraluminal masses compressing. [**10-27**] an attempt was made to\nextubate him, but he afterwards developed stridor and had to be\nre-intubated. During the brief extubation, a laryngoscopy was\ndone that was concerning for at least partial paralysis of the\nvocal cords. He was treated with 24 hours of IV solumedrol in\ncase there was a contribution of airway swelling. [**10-29**] he had a\ntracheostomy placed by the ENT service with some difficulty\nbecause of his severe scoliosis and altered anatomy. Afterwards\nhe was quickly weaned to a trach collar. With the concomitant\ndysphagia, there was concern for neuromuscular weakness, so\nneurology was consulted. Their work-up consisted of MRI, which\nfailed to demonstrate a lesion that would explain the pathology\nfound. The next test Neurology recommended was an EMG, this\ndemonstrated a pattern consistent with a myopathy. The\nneuromuscular service was consulted to evaluate the LEMG and\nguide further diagnostic studies. LEMG was EMG suggestive of\nneuromuscular junction disorder. He was discharged with\nfollow-up with the neuromuscular clinic and ENT.\n\n#. Dysphagia: patient had been having several weeks of worsening\ndysphagia prior to admission, including weight loss. He had an\nEGD [**2179-10-2**] for similar symptoms that did not show a cause for\ndysphagia. Patient declined video swallow study.\n\n#. Hyponatremia: Most likely hypovolemic as this improved with\nIV fluids. Likely from poor PO intake [**1-6**] dysphagia. This\nresolved with tube feeds.\n\n#. Anemia: at baseline, no evidence of active bleeding, with low\niron [**9-14**], nl ferritin, iron/TIBC<18 concerning for iron\ndeficiency. Likely from poor PO intake.\n\n#. Tachycardia: sinus, likely due to resp distress.\n\nTransitional Issues:\nThere are several tests requested by Neurology that were sent\noff by pathology to outside facility that are pending prior to\ndischarge. Patient should follow up with outpatient Neurology\nregarding these tests.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1. salmeterol 50 mcg/dose Disk with Device [**Month/Year (2) **]: One (1) Disk\nwith Device Inhalation Q12H (every 12 hours).\n2.
