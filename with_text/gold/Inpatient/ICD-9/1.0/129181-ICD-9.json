The patient was\n brought to the neuro-interventional suite and placed in supine position on the\n angiography table.  A preprocedure huddle and timeout was performed as per\n [**Hospital1 51**] protocol.  The patient was draped and prepped in the usual sterile\n fashion.  Using a micropuncture set, intra-arterial access was obtained into\n the right femoral artery.  The above-mentioned vessels were selected, and\n angiogram were performed in the AP, lateral, and oblique projections with\n three-dimensional rotation acquisitions where appropriate.\n\n There were no immediate complications of the procedure.

There is minimal\n narrowing at the origin of the right internal carotid artery which is not flow\n limiting.\n\n RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:\n\n The right internal carotid artery demonstrates non-flow-limiting minimal\n stenosis at its origin.  No abnormality otherwise seen in the course of the\n right internal carotid artery.  The ACA and MCA branches are patent.  No\n aneurysm, AVM or fistula was noted.\n\n LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY:\n\n Selective injection of the left common carotid artery demonstrates brisk\n filling of the external and internal carotid arteries and ACA and MCA\n branches.
