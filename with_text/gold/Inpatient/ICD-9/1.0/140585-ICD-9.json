The\naortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is\ncritical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Moderate\n(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral\nregurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nPost-CPB:\nThe patient is A-Paced, on no inotropes.\nPreserved biventricular systolic fxn.\nThere is a prosthetic aortic valve with no leak and no\nregurgitation.\nMean residual gradient = 10 mmHg.\nNo MR.

She operative note for\ndetails.  She weaned from bypass easily on Propofol alone.  She\nawoke anxious but intact, requiring nitroglycerin intravenously\nfor BP control.  She was extubated on POD 1 and oral agents\n(Valsartan and Lopressor). Diuresis towards her preoperative\nweight was begun and she transferred to the floor on POD 2.\n\nPhysical Therapy worked with her for strength and mobility.  CTs\nand temporary pacing wires were removed per protocols.  She had\na brief episode of atrial fibrillation in the 140s on POD 4,\nwhich was well tolerated.  This was treated with IV Lopressor\nand amiodarone with restoration of sinus rhythm.  She remained\nvolume overloaded and was discharged to rehab on IV lasix for 1\nweek.\n\nOn POD 5 she was ready for discharge and went TO [**Hospital 38**] Rehab\na MWMC in [**Location (un) 1110**].\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMetoprolol ER 25 daily\nSimvastatin 40 daily\nZetia 10 daily\nNTG-sl-prn\nAspirin 325 daily\nDiovan 320 daily\nFish Oil\nVitamin E 400IU daily\nVitamin D 500mg daily\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q4H (every\n4 hours) as needed for pain.\n2. ezetimibe 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n\n3. simvastatin 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\n4. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
