The low tylenol level and\nlack of elevation in LFT does not support overdose of such\nextent.  However, the benadryl in Tylenol PM could potentially\ndelay the absorption and administration of alcohol in the same\ntime could be hepatic protective by competing with tylenol for\ncytochrome C.  An N-acetylcysteine protocol was initiated at ED\nand continued initially in the MICU.  Her Tylenol level was\ntrended till non-detectable.\n.\n# ASA intoxication: The elevated ASA level is likely a result\nfrom Excedrin overdose.  Pt was treated conservative with fluid\nhydration, and monitored closely on the rising ASA level.  There\nwas an anion gap initially, which was closed shortly after\ntreatment.  Her ASA level was trended till non-detectable.\n.\n# SI: Pt had a history of depression and suicidal ideation.  She\nwas evaluated by on-call psychiatrist in the ED.  The\npsychiatrist at her college was notified.  We restarted her\neffexor after her nausea resolved. Medically cleared for\ntransfer to psychiatric facility.\n.\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n# Anemia: Pt has known anemia from thalassemia.  No transfusion\ngiven. No evidence of iron deficiency.\n.\nTransitions of care:\nOutpatient management of anemia.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nVenlafaxine XR 225 mg PO\naltavera\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. venlafaxine 225 mg Tablet Extended Rel 24 hr Sig: One (1)\nTablet Extended Rel 24 hr PO once a day.\n2. Altavera (28) 0.15-30 mg-mcg Tablet Sig: as directed\npreviously Tablet PO Daily ().\n\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExtended Care\n\nFacility:\nFour Winds Saratoga\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary:\ntylenol / aspirin overdose\n\nSecondary:\ndepression\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nIt was a pleasure participating in your care at [**Hospital1 18**]. You were\nadmitted to the hospital for taking too much tylenol and\naspirin. You were treated for this and improved and were deemed\nmedically clear for transfer to a facility that specializes in\npsychiatric care.\n\nREGARDING YOUR MEDICATIONS...\nno changes were made to your medications\n\nOtherwise, it is very important that you take all of your usual\nhome medications as directed in your discharge paperwork.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nOtherwise, please followup with your primary care physician\n[**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 7-10 days regarding the course of this hospitalization.\n\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2142-9-10**]"
