An additional 3-mm\npulmonary nodule in the right middle lobe is also present\n(4:84). There is paraseptal emphysema, predominantly in the\nupper lobes bilaterally, with prominent apical bullae.\nThere are small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent\natelectasis. There is no evidence of pulmonary infection. Linear\natelectasis is noted within the lingula. The airways are clear.\n\nPatient is status post CABG. There are small retrosternal fluid\ncollections, many of which contain small air-fluid levels. Other\nthan expected mild stranding within the subcutaneous fat, the\nchest wall subcutaneous fat remains preserved. There is no\npresternal fluid collection.\nThis examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic\nevaluation. A small\ncalcified granuloma is noted within the right lobe of the liver.\nOtherwise, the non-contrast appearance of the upper abdomen is\nwithin normal limits.\nBONE WINDOWS: Patient is status post recent sternotomy. There is\nno evidence of dehiscence or sternal wire fractures. There is no\nerosion of the bone.  There are no osseous lesions concerning\nfor metastatic disease.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. 5-mm right apical and 3-mm right middle lobe pulmonary\nnodules. Six-month followup chest CT is recommended.\n2. Moderate paraseptal emphysema with prominent apical bullae.\n3. No evidence of pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural effusions\nwith adjacent atelectasis.\n4. Multiple small retrosternal fluid collections, some with\nair-fluid levels, not unexpected in this recently post-surgical\npatient. No sternal dehiscence or evidence of sternal wire\nfracture. No presternal fluid collection.\n\nRadiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2132-2-18**] 2:03\nPM\nFinal Report\nThe right IJ line has been removed.\nThe lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting background COPD, with\nprominent\nbullous change in the upper lobes bilaterally.\nThere are multiple sternal wires, similar in configuration to\n[**2132-2-17**]. No\nobvious break in the sternal wires is identified. Mediastinal\nclips\nconsistent with CABG are present. he cardiomediastinal\nsilhouette is stable compared with one day earlier, with\nmild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and an unfolded aorta.\nSlight patchy opacity at the left base is overall unchanged.\nLeft pleural\neffusion is smaller. Doubt CHF.\nAgain seen is the nodular opacity at the right lung apex,\nIMPRESSION:\n1. COPD and cardiomegaly.\n2. Patchy opacity left base, essentially unchanged.\n3. Small nodule at right lung apex again seen. Please see\nrecommendation for CT, described on prior CXR report.\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the\noperating room on [**2-14**] where the patient underwent coronary\nartery bypass grafing x3 please see operative report for\ndetails. In summary he had: Coronary artery bypass grafting x3\nto left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending\nartery, bypass from the ascending aorta to the obtuse marginal\nbranch of the circumflex artery using reverse\nautologous saphenous vein graft and bypass from ascending aorta\nto the diagonal artery branch of left anterior descending artery\nusing reverse autologous saphenous vein graft. His bypass time\nwas 76 minutes with a crossclamp time of 62 minutes.\n The patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively\nwas transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery\nand monitoring. POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and\noriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was\nneurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, phenylephrine\nwas sucessfully weaned off. Beta blocker was initiated and the\npatient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The\npatient was transferred to the telemetry floor on POD #1 for\nfurther recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were\ndiscontinued per cardiac surgery protocol.  The patient was\nevaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with\nstrength and mobility.  The remainder of his hospital course was\nuneventful, by the time of discharge on POD6*the patient was\nambulating freely, the wound had small amount od bloody drainage\nfrom mid incision, and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.\n The patient was discharged home with visiting nurses in good\ncondition with appropriate follow up instructions.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nLisinopril 10 daily, atenolol 25 daily, HCTZ 25 daily, ASA 325\ndaily, omeprazole 20 daily, spiriva,\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. simvastatin 10 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n2. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
