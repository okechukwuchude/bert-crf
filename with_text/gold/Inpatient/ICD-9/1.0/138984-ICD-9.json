COPD presents from home with acute shortness of breath. He\nreports drinking ETOH tonight, but denies aspiration. The\npatient was found by EMS to not be able to talk in complete\nsentences. His BPs were 220s/140s. He received nitro spray x 4\nenroute with BiPAP with mild improvement.\n.\nIn the ED, initial VS were 138 139/126 28 97% on CPAP. Initially\nhe was thought to have CHF exacerbation, so was treated with\nmorphine, nitro drip. He then was found to have a rectal temp of\n103.6 and CXR returned with large RLL infiltrate. Nitro drip was\nstopped and he was given 1300mg PR tylenol. He was then treated\nfor suspected aspiration PNA with vanc/levofloxacin/flagyl. ETOH\nnegative despite report of ETOH use tonight. He was maintained\non CPAP 10/5 now with FiO2 100%, satting 100%. After report was\ngiven, attempt to titrate off non-invasive mechanical\nventilation was attempted given concern for autopeep with BPs in\nthe 80s. He was placed on NRB with adequate saturation, however\nfelt more dyspnea, thus non-invasive was restarted. He was given\na total of 2L NS for fluid resuscitation. 2 PIVs were placed.\n.\nUpon arrival to the ICU, the patient reports improvement in\nsymptoms.

The left atrium is\nelongated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.\nThere is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal\ncavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic\ndysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal-mid infero-lateral\nwalls. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal\n(LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall\nmotion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened (?#). There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area\n1.2-1.9cm2). There is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric,\nposteriorly directed jet of Mild to moderate ([**12-12**]+) mitral\nregurgitation is seen without clear evidence of mitral valve\nprolapse or significant anterior mitral leaflet tethering. There\nis mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with\nmild focal LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild aortic\nstenosis. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.\n.\nCXR:\n1. Opacification at the right base concerning for aspiration\npneumonia.\n2. Diffuse haziness in the right lung likely due to asymmetric\nedema, particularly as the patient was found lying on his right\nside for a prolonged period of time.\n.\nVIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW:\n1. Gross aspiration seen with thin barium and penetration seen\nwith\nnectar-thickened barium.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nBRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:\nMr. [**Known lastname **] is an 87y/o gentleman with history of CAD s/p CABG,\nCHF who was admitted to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure\nthat was likely secondary to CAP with possible aspiration event.\nHis respiratory status was stable, he was treated with\nantibiotics, and he was discharged home.\n.\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n==============\n# Hypoxic respiratory failure: resolved.\nEtiology was likely multifactorial due to aspiration vs\ncommunity acquired PNA with component of flash pulmonary edema.\nPatient does have a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonias\nwhich were thought to be due to his esophageal stenosis, GERD,\nand nocturnal reflux. Aspiration was seen on video swallow.\nIn the ED, he was treated with morphine and nitro drip for a CHF\nexacerbation and then found to have temp of 103.6 rectally.\nNitro drip was stopped and he was treated with vanco,\nlevofloxacin, and flagyl for aspiration PNA. He was maintained\non CPAP and transferred to the MCIU on a non-rebreather with O2\nsats 93%. In the MICU, he was changed to azithromycin and\nceftriaxone and improved overnight to breathing comfortably on\nroom air. His legionella was negative and sputum sample was\ncontaminated. Because the patient woke up in the early morning\nwith acute dyspnea and had elevated BP on admission, flash\npulmonary edema was a concern as well and TTE was done which\nshowed mild MR, mild AS, mild focal LV systolic [**Last Name (LF) 20559**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]\n50-55% with an eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of mild to\nmoderate MR. This likely explains the unilateral pleural\neffusion. For his pneumonia likely due to aspiration, patient\nwas changed from IV antibiotics to PO augmentin.  He was\ndischarged home with plans to complete a course of PO Augmentin.\n Was counseled about modified diet to prevent aspiration events.\n He will follow up with his PCP.\n.\n# Hypotension:  Resolved.\nWas hypertensive per EMS which was treated with morphine, nitro\ngiven in the setting of SIRS/sepsis.  Fluid resuscitated with 2L\nIVF in the ED. Patient likely flashed in setting of hypertension\nduring REM sleep prior to admission. He remained normotensive in\nthe MICU and his carvedilol and lisinopril were restarted at\nhome doses.  His BP was reasonably controlled on the medical\nfloor as well.  His hypertension regimen was not adjusted; he\nwill f/u with his PCP after discharge.\n.\n# CHF: EF 50-55% on TTE this admission. As above, patient likely\nhad flash pulmonary edema in setting of hypertension prior to\nadmission, in addition to pneumonia. He had a unilateral pleural\neffusion, but did not appear to be fluid overloaded on exam. He\nwas not diuresed and restarted on his home carvedilol and\nlisinopril.\n.\nINACTIVE ISSUES\n.\n# CAD s/p 2 CABGs and AVR in [**1-19**]: stable.\nThere did not appear to be a cardiac etiology to patient's\nrespiratory distress and he was ruled out for MI with serial\nenzymes. He does take plavix though it is unclear for what\nreason. He has not taken coumadin so his AVR is likely to be\nbioprosthetic. He was continued on aspirin and plavix and was\ndischarged with instructions to follow up with his PCP.\n.\n# COPD: stable.\nPatient has remote smoking history and currently takes advair\ndiskuk and porair at home. He was given nebulizers throughout\nhospitalization though no evidence of COPD exacerbation.\n.\n# Hyperlipidemia: stable.\nHe was continued on home statin.\n.\n# GERD: stable.\nReflux likely contributes to his aspiration.  He was continued\non home omeprazole.\n.\nTRANSITION OF CARE:\n===================\n# Labs pending at discharge: none.\n# Follow-up: Patient was instructed to follow up with his PCP.\n# Communication: Patient and son/HCP [**Name (NI) **]\n# Emergency Contact: [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] (son) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 89317**]\n# Code: Full Code\n\nMedications on Admission:\nCarvedilol 3.125mg [**Hospital1 **]\nLisinopril 2.5mg daily\nPlavix 75mg daily\nSimvastatin 20mg qhs\nOmperazole 20mg daily\nAdvair 500-50mcg/dose 1 puff [**Hospital1 **]\nproair HFA 108 mcg/act 2 puffs every 4hrs prn\nRobaxin 500mg 1 tab QID\nNeurontin 300mg TID\nPercoset 5-325mg 1 tab q6hr prn\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. carvedilol 3.125 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\n2. lisinopril 5 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n3. clopidogrel 75 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\n4. simvastatin 10 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\n5. omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)
