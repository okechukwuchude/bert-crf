Ongoing hypoxia with 3-4L O2\nrequirement was felt to be due to resolving infection as well as\nvolume overlaod so he was diuresed with IV Lasix, recently 40mg\nIV BID.

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion\nare normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus\nlevel. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There\nis mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion. With injectin of aerated saline, there are\n2 bubbles in the LV within 3 heart beats and a flurry of\ncontrast after 6-7 beats. This is most consistent with\ntranspulmonary shunting, although with several early bubbles, a\nconcurrent PFO cannot be excluded.\n\nIMPRESSION: Likely transpulmonary shunting. Normal biventricular\nsystolic function.\n.\n[**8-23**] CXR- #1. Bibasilar atelectasis and small effusions. 2.\nDobbhoff tube coiled in the stomach.\n.\n[**8-23**] CXR #2- Left PICC line ends at the junction of the\nbrachiocephalic veins. Lung volumes remain very low, but the\nclearing of opacification at the left lung base suggest that\nthis was largely atelectasis. Mild interstitial abnormality and\nplate-like scarring in the right lung are unchanged. Heart size\nis normal. Feeding tube coils in the upper stomach and passes\nout of view. No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.\nHeart size normal.\n.\n[**8-23**] EGD- Varices at the lower third of the esophagus and\ngastroesophageal junction. Ulcer in the gastroesophageal\njunction. Food in the whole stomach. Granularity, erythema,\ncongestion, abnormal vascularity and mosaic appearance in the\nwhole stomach compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy.\nSuccessful endoscopic placement of 10Fr [**Last Name (un) **]-jejunal feeding\ntube to 130 cm from the nares. Successful placement of 10Fr\n[**Last Name (un) **]-pharyngeal Bridle. Otherwise normal EGD to third part of\nthe duodenum\n.\n[**8-24**] Colonoscopy- Angioectasia in the sigmoid colon. Stool in\nthe hepatic flexure and ascending colon. Non-bleeding rectal\nvarices were noted. No significant lesions were identified,\nalthough a small polyp could not be excluded at the hepatic\nflexure due to the presence of stool. Otherwise normal\ncolonoscopy to cecum\n.\nDischarge Labs:\n[**8-26**]: WBC 7.2 Hgb 9.6* Hct 27.9* MCV 101* Plt 115\n[**8-26**]: Gluc 158* BUN 42* Crt 1.4* Na 135 K 4.4 Cl 105 HCO3 20*\n[**8-26**]: ALT 23 AST 46* AKP 157* TB 1.6*\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n51yo man with EtOH cirrhosis c/b refractory ascites s/p his 3rd\nepisode of variceal bleed and banding who presents from outside\nhospital with resolving pneumonia, ongoing hypoxia .\n.\n#Hypoxia: Patient presented from outside hospital with oxygen\nrequirement s/p treatment for a pneumonia. CXRs were repeated\nand showed resolving pneumonia. His persistent hypoxia was\nattributed to the resolving treated pneumonia, transpulmonary\nshunting (TTE on [**8-16**] consistent with this), likely smoking\nrelated parenchymal lung disease, deconditioning with poor\nclearance of upper airway secretions and restriction from large\nvolume ascites. Patient was treated with aggressive pulmonary\ntoilet (chest physical therapy, incentive spirometry), frequent\nnebulizer treatments and large volume paracenteses (3 L on [**8-17**] L on [**8-19**] L on [**8-23**] L on [**8-26**]) with marked improvement.\nOn discharge, patient was breathing comfortably on room air.\n\nFollow Up:\nWe recommend that his nebulizer treatments be continued as\nneeded in the outpatient setting and the patient be encouraged\nto mobilize and use an incentive spirometer.\n.\n# Alcoholic cirrhosis: Patient with history of alcoholic\ncirrhosis c/b refractory ascites (typically gets taps every two\nweeks) and variceal bleeds x3, now s/p banding in OSH. Patient\nwas initially continued on octreotide drip and IV PPI.\nOctreotide was d/c-ed and patient was transitioned to oral PPI.\nHe was started on nadolol which was titrated to 20 mg daily\ngiven limited blood pressure room. Patient underwent EGD to\nassess his variceal status after banding which showed an ulcer\nin the GE junction and 3 cords of grade I bands in the lower\nthird of the esophagus. He was started on sucralfate in addition\nto his standing nadolol and PPI. He was given lactulose and\nrifaximin which were titrated to his mental status. He had some\nencephelopathy during his ICU admission, but this resolved\nshortly after his transfer to the floor with aggressive\nlactulose treatment. He underwent diagnostic paracentesis in the\nMICU (negative for SBP) and several therapeutic paracenteses\n([**8-17**]- 3L, [**8-19**] 10L, [**8-23**] 3L, [**8-26**] 4L) which were also negative\nfor SBP. Patient was appropriately repleted with albumin\npost-tap.\n.\nAs part of his transplant evaluation patient underwent\nechocardiogram w/ bubble study which showed transpulmonary\nshunting with supine room air ABG pO2 57, though the patient had\nno orthodeoxia. Cardiology was consulted and felt that there was\nno need for further pre-transplant workup- should the patient\ndevelop cardiac symptoms they recommended possible CTA of the\ncoronaries. Patient also underwent colonoscopy which showed\nangioectasia in the sigmoid colon and non-bleeding rectal\nvarices. [**Doctor First Name **] (negative), anti-smooth muscle (negative) and IgG\n(nl), IgA (c/w alcoholic cirrhosis), and IgM (negative) were\nsent.\n\nFollow Up:\nPatient will require PFTs in the outpatient setting and f/u with\nhis transplant hepatologist - these are scheduled for [**9-2**].\n.\n#. [**Last Name (un) **]: Patient's creatinine was elevated around 1.3 (and as\nhigh as 1.5) during this admission from baseline 0.8-0.9. This\nwas attributed to poor volume status due to bleeding and\ndiuresis in the OSH. He responded partially to albumin, but\ncreatinine on discharge remained stable around 1.3. Other\ncontributing factors may be increased intra-abdominal pressure\nsecondary to ascites vs. hepatorenal syndrome. Would recommend\nfurther evaluation and consideration of treatment for\nhepatorenal syndrome.\n.\n# Anemia - Patient's anemia was likely multifactorial and\nrelated to acute bleed and cirrhosis. Received 2 units\ntransfusion in the MICU without active bleeding throughout his\n[**Hospital1 18**] hospitalization. Hct remained stable, guaiac negative, and\npatient was supplemented with B12 and folate. Hemolysis labs\nwere negative.\n.\n#Hyponatremia: History of hyponatremia to 120 at admission to\nOSH. This was attributed to the hemodynamics of his cirrhosis\nand recurrent ascites. Patient was fluid restricted and became\nslightly hypernatremic once tube feeds were started. Fluid\nrestriction was removed and sodium normalized.\n.\n# Hyperglycemia- Patient became hyperglycemic (sugars in the\n160s -180s) with tube feeds. He was started on an insulin\nsliding scale and typically received 8 units of sliding scale\ninsulin daily. We recommend that this be followed up in the\noutpatient setting and patient evaluated further for diabetes\nand oral anti-hyperglycemics considered. During rehab stay, can\nconsider a regular insulin sliding scale if sugars remain\nelevated.\n.\n# FEN: Patient was given a low sodium diet and was evaluated by\nnutrition specialists who restarted him on tube feeds. He was\nalso supplemented with ensure, thiamine, folate, cyanocobalamin,\nand a multivitamin. His tubefeeds and vitamins should be\ncontinued on discharge.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nHome Meds:\n- albuterol inhaler 2puffs PO daily\n- Vitamin D2 50,000 units PO weekly\n- Lasix 80mg daily (on hold since [**7-4**] due to hyponatremia)\n- Lactulose 15ml PO TID\n- Prevacid 15mg PO daily\n- Spironolactone 200mg PO daily (on hold since [**7-4**] due to\nhyponatremia)\n- Folic acid 0.4mg PO daily\n.\nMedications (from OSH records):\nCefePIME 1 g IV Q12H\nVancomycin 1000 mg IV Q 12H\nPantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H\nFurosemide 40 mg IV BID\nLactulose 30 mL PO/NG TID\nBisacodyl 10 mg PO/PR DAILY:PRN Constipation\nDocusate Sodium (Liquid) 100 mg PO BID\nSenna 1 TAB PO BID:PRN Constipation\nMultivitamins 10 mL IV Q24H\nFoLIC Acid 1 mg PO/NG DAILY\nThiamine 100 mg IV DAILY\nNicotine Patch 14 mg TD DAILY\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
