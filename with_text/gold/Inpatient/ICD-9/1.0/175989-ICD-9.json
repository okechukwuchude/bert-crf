He\nwas worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. A carotid duplex\nultrasound was obtained which showed less then a 40% bilateral\ninternal carotid artery stenosis. A dental consult was obtained\nwhich found no contraindication for surgery after obtaining a\nPanorex x-ray of his teeth. A chest CT scan was performed which\nshowed no significant aortic calcifications but did note a right\nlower lobe 6 mm spiculated nodule that should be reassessed in\nthree months for assessment of stability to exclude the\npossibility of neoplastic growth. Labs showed that he had\nelevated liver function studies. On [**2141-5-12**], Mr. [**Known lastname 13621**] was taken\nto the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass\ngrafting to three vessels and replacement of his aortic valve\nwith a tissue valve. Please see operative note for details.\nPostoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for\nmonitoring. Over the next several hours he awoke and was\nextubated. He was noted to have some confusion, hallucinations\nand somnolence. A head CT scan was obtained which was negative.\nThe stroke service was consulted who suspected a metabolic or\npossible infectious etiology to his confusion- no acute\ninfection was detected. All narcotics were discontinued and his\npain was managed with Tylenol only. Over the next day, his\nmental status cleared. Aspirin, beta blocker, statin therapy and\ndiabetic management were continued. Mild confusion noted again\non POD#4 and Ultram was discontinued.. Confusion improved. POD#5\nhe went into rapid a-fib  and remained in it for several hours,\nwas started on Amio and returned to SR for 24 hours prior to\ndischarge. He failed first and second voiding trial, urology was\nconsulted and it was determined that he would be discharged to\nhome with the foley in place and will follow up with urology as\nan outpatient. After second foley placement his urine was noted\nto be cloudy. A UA C&S was sent and he was started on Cipro.\nCultures were negative and Cipro was discontinued. He was noted\nto have some serosanguinous drainage from his mid sternal pole.\nHe was afebrile, CXR showed intact wires, and WBC was normal. He\nwas sent home on no antibiotics and will return for a wound\ncheck on [**5-23**]. He was seen by the physical therapy department\nand cleared for discharge. By time of discharge on POD #6 he was\ndeemed safe for discharge to home. Follow-up appointments were\nadvised.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\naspirin 81 mg QD, glipizide 5 mg QD, glucophage 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **],\nlisinopril 5 mg QD, metoprolol extended release 50 mg QD\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
