On [**2182-12-9**], the\npatient underwent bronchoscopy for cryotherapy debridment of the\nmetallic left main stent under rigid bronchoscopy followed by\nesophageal dilation via thoracic surgery.  Her post operative\ncourse was complicated by respiratory distress and profound\nbronchospasm, which responded to positive pressure noninvasive\nventilation and albuterol nebs. The patient was monitored\novernight, and discharged on [**2182-12-10**].  The patient presented to\nan OSH ED on [**2182-12-11**] early am complaining of SOB that had\nstarted the prior evening.

She has 3 siblings (one\nbrother has a history of testicular cancer).  She has no\nchildren.\n\n\nPhysical Exam:\nVS: Afebrile, 130, 100/58, 34, 100% on AC\nGen: Petite woman, appears older than stated age, sedated\nHEENT: left pupil>right pupil, both reactive, no icterus, MMM\nNeck: Supple, no cervical LAD, no supraclavicular LAD\nHeart: tachycardic, no m/r/g\nPulm: Coarse & diffuse bronchial breath sounds and rhonchi\nbilateral anteriorly\nChest: left chest port in place\nAbd: soft, flat, NT/ND, no hepatosplenomegaly\nExt: 2+ pulses, warm, no cyanosis or edema\nNeuro: Sedated, does not respond to noxious stimuli\nSkin: No rashes\n\n\nPertinent Results:\nLabs on admission:\n.\n[**2182-12-11**] 07:18AM   WBC-25.3* RBC-3.03* HGB-9.1* HCT-27.6* MCV-91\nMCH-30.0 MCHC-32.9 RDW-14.0\n[**2182-12-11**] 07:18AM   NEUTS-83* BANDS-6* LYMPHS-5* MONOS-4 EOS-0\nBASOS-0 ATYPS-0 METAS-2* MYELOS-0\n[**2182-12-11**] 07:18AM   PT-15.1* PTT-25.5 INR(PT)-1.3*\n[**2182-12-11**] 07:24AM   LACTATE-0.7\n[**2182-12-11**] 04:12PM   GLUCOSE-66* UREA N-8 CREAT-0.2* SODIUM-142\nPOTASSIUM-4.3 CHLORIDE-115* TOTAL CO2-21* ANION GAP-10\n.\nCT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2182-12-22**]\n1. Interval improvement in right lower lobe consolidation,\nhowever\ndevelopment of patchy consolidations and ground-glass opacities\nthroughout\nalmost the entire left lung. Ground-glass opacity also involves\nthe right\nlower lobe and right upper lobe. The differential diagnosis is\nbroad, as\nfindings are nonspecific, and includes infection, edema and\nhemorrhage.\n2. No specific signs of empyema, however, superinfection of\nsimple pleural\neffusions cannot be excluded.\n3. No abdominal fluid collection.\n4. Decompressed distal descending and sigmoid colon. No clear\nwall thickening.\n5. Trace abdominal ascites.\n6. Mild perirectal stranding. The differential diagnosis\nincludes proctitis and third spacing in the setting of fluid\noverload.\n.\nECHO [**2182-12-23**]:\nThe left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left\nventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global\nsystolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve\nleaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not\npresent. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve\nleaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-5**]+) mitral\nregurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery\nsystolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n.\nIMPRESSION: Mild moderate mitral regurgitation. Normal\nbiventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional\nbiventricular systolic function.\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-3-6**], the\nfindings are similar.\n.\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:\nBased on [**2179**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n.\nG-TUBE PLACEMENT [**2182-12-25**]:\nSuccessful uncomplicated placement of 12 French Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 12433**]\ngastrostomy feeding tube. The tube can be used after 24 hours\nand needs to be left to\ngravity drainage overnight.\n.\nLENIS [**2182-12-20**]:\nNo evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.\n.\nABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND [**2182-12-31**]:  No ascites in all four\nquadrants.  No subcutaneous fluid collection about G-tube\ninsertion site.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThis is a 40-year-old woman with a history of ALL, s/p BMT [**2151**]\ncomplicated by radiation therapy-related pulmonary fibrosis\nrequiring LLL lung transplant from her father [**5-/2171**] (on no\nimmunosuppresants), further complicated by L main stem bronchus\nstenosis s/p metal stent placement [**9-/2176**] requiring serial\ndebridements over the years who on [**2182-12-9**] had bronchoscopy with\ndebridement/cryotherapy and EGD with esophageal dilatation and\npresents [**2182-12-11**] with hypercarbic respiratory failure.\n\n# RESPIRATORY FAILURE: One day prior to admission, patient\nunderwent IP stenting, debridement and re-opening of stenosis as\nwell as esophageal manipulation.  On admisison, Ms. [**Known lastname 27785**] had\nimpressive multi-focal infiltrates suggestive of overwhelming\npneumonia, likely the result of recent manipulations.  Patient\nwas started on broad spectrum antibiotics (initially Vanc/\nzosyn/ levoflox/ tobramycin/ tamiflu-->subsequently\nNaf/Cipro/zosyn/Azithro then Naf/Vanc/Cipro/Azithro); her final\nantibiotic regimen includes VANCOMYCIN and CEFEPIME.  She will\nfinish a 14-day course of vancomycin and cefepime on [**2183-1-6**].\n.\nMs. [**Known lastname 27785**] was eventually extubated on [**12-20**] however, became\nincreasingly tachycardic and tachypneic with RR of 40 and was\nunable to speak in full sentances.  Ms. [**Known lastname 27785**] was re-intubated\non [**12-21**].  She underwent bronchoscopy on [**12-24**] for evaluation of\nstent patency (was patent).  Lower extremity dopplers on [**12-20**]\nwere negative for DVTs.  Percutaneous Tracheostomy was placed on\n[**12-27**] and ventilator setting were slowly weaned.  Prior to\ntransfer, patient was doing well on trach collar.  She\noccasionally required suctioning for mucus plugging.\n.\n# LEUKOCYTOSIS: Trended down once antibiotics changed to Vanco\nand Cefepime on [**12-22**]. All repeat cultures NGTD.  Only culture\npending is a B-glucan.\n.\n# HYPOTENSION:  Patient had hypotension requiring neosynephrine.\nThis was felt to be secondary to infection/sepsis, sedation and\nPEEP. Pressors were weaned off on [**12-26**] and she remained\nhemodynamically stable with MAP> 55-60.\n.\n#. RIGHT GOING HEMATOMA: Small hematoma at sight of prior\nfemoral line.\n.\n# ELEVATED LIVER ENZYMES:  with mixed pattern of hepatocellular\ninjury and cholestasis.  DDx is resolving shock, drug toxicity\nand also acalculous cholecystitis. Per US on [**12-13**], Ms. [**Known lastname 27785**]\nis status-post cholecystectomy.  Enzymes are trending down.\n.\n# MALNUTRITION WITH COAGULOPATHY, ANEMIA, AND HYPOCALCEMIA:  A\nG-tube was placed and Ms. [**Known lastname 27785**] was started on Nutren\nPulmonary TFs.  These were supplemented with MCT. Banana flakes\nwere added for diarrhea; c.diff was negative.\n.\n# ANEMIA:  Hematocrit basically remained stable throughout\nhospitalization.  Patient was guaiac positive from below\nintermittently, though unclear source.  Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 34709**] was\nmaintained on an H2 blocker.\n.\n# ANXIETY AND NIGHTMARES:  Amitryptyline 20 qhs.\n.\n# ABDOMINAL PAIN:  Ms. [**Known lastname 27785**] complained of abdominal pain\naround the site of her G-tube.  An ultrasound was performed on\n[**12-31**], which was negative for subcutaneous fluid collection\nabout G-tube insertion site.\n.\n# POSITIVE B-GLUCAN:  B-glucan was positive during admission.\nThere are multiple reasons for a positive B-glucan aside from\nfungal infection.  Ms. [**Known lastname 27785**] was [**Doctor Last Name **] exceptionally well on\nvancomycin and cefepime and as such, fungal coverage was not\nstarted.  If patient does poorly, she will need to be\nre-evaluated with fungal infection on the differential.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nPer records, unable to be reconciled\namitriptyline 20 mg daily, carvedilol 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **], codeine\nsulfate 15 mg q4-6h prn cough, estradiol 10 mcg vaginal\nsuppository 3x weekly, estradiol-levonorgestrel 0.045-0.015\nmg/24 hr TD weekly, cholecalciferol 1,000U daily, medium chain\ntriglycerides (7.7 kcal/mL) 1 tbsp TID (pt cannot afford med\nyet), Nutren Pulmonary Lacfree 3 cans daily, polyvinyl alcohol\ndrops prn, Vit K 100mcg daily\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. heparin (porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution Sig: One (1)\nInjection [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day).\n2. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a\nday) as needed for constipation.\n3. polyvinyl alcohol-povidone 1.4-0.6 % Dropperette Sig: [**1-5**]\nDrops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dryness.\n4. amitriptyline 10 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO HS (at\nbedtime).\n5. chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12 % Mouthwash Sig: One (1) ML\nMucous membrane [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day).\n6. ipratropium bromide 17 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig:\nTwo (2) Puff Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for\nsob/wheeze.\n7. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig:\nSix (6) Puff Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for\nsob/wheeze.\n8. white petrolatum-mineral oil 56.8-42.5 % Ointment Sig: One\n(1) Appl Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dryness.\n9. miconazole nitrate 2 % Powder Sig: One (1) Appl Topical [**Hospital1 **]\n(2 times a day).\n10. fentanyl 50 mcg/hr Patch 72 hr Sig: One (1) Patch 72 hr\nTransdermal Q72H (every 72 hours).\n11. camphor-menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) Appl Topical\n[**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for itching.\n12. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H\n(every 6 hours) as needed for pain or fever.\n13. medium chain triglycerides 7.7 kcal/mL Oil Sig: Fifteen (15)\nML PO BID (2 times a day).\n14. docusate sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2\ntimes a day) as needed for constipation.\n15.

This was further complicated by left main stem stenosis\nrequiring metal stent placement 5 years ago. Since then she has\nbeen requiring repeated bronchoscopies for stent evaluation,\nclean out and granulation tissue removal. She was last seen by\ninterventional pulmonary service in [**2182-5-4**]. After that time\nshe\nhad been doing OK in terms of her breathing, but about one month\nago she started having dry cough, and then dyspnea on exertion,\nboth of which have been worsening, which prompted her consult\nwith us today. Her cough is worse at night, and is not\nproductive. Her dyspnea is currently with mild to moderate\nexertion, like going up one flight of stairs. She was brought in\nfor rigid bronch and cryoablation of left main stem granulation\ntissue.\n\nThe patient also has esophageal stricture requiring past EGD\nwith dilation.
