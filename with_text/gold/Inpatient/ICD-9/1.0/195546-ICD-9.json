His blood\ngasses showed significant hypercarbia and he was initially\nwheezing on exam, making COPD exacerbation the most likely\ndiagnosis.  Patient had significant improvement with nebs,\nsteroids, antibiotics, lasix.  Got ceftaz/levaquin to cover\nsevere CAP, however ceftaz stopped given lack of cough, fever,\nwbc or clinical suggestion of pneumonia.   He initially diuresed\n1L with lasix, but appeared euvolemic so did not have\nsignificant further lasix. Patient will be discharged on slow\nPrednisone 40mg PO taper and placed on Spiriva/Combivent/Duoneb.\nPatient was observed in the MICU on non-rebreather until\ndetermined to be stable for the floor. Patient completed a seven\nday course of Levoquin. Cultures were negative through the\ncourse of the admission. At the time of discharge patient was\nsating 94% on baseline oxygen of 2L and 87% 2L on ambulation.\n\n#  HTN.  Patient has HTN.  Home cardiac meds appear to be\ndiltiazem 240mg [**Hospital1 **] and no BB as well as cozar.  Meds doses\ntaken from PCP by phone (from memory) which agreed with\npaperwork from [**Hospital3 5365**]. Patient's pressures were too low\nand the regimen was changed to Diltiazem ER 240 daily.\n\n#  PAF/MAT?.  In house patient had one episode of irregular\nheart rate on telemetry.  It remains unclear if this was PAF vs\nMAT.  Given the setting of severe COPD exacerbation it is more\nlikely to be MAT.   Rhythm rapidly converted spontaneously and\nhe remained in NSR over the next 48 hours.  The patient does\nhave a history of PAF (athough details unknown).  Given this\nhistory and unclear event in hospital, the patient was started\non Aspirin 325mg PO daily and instructed to further discuss with\nhis PCP with regards to coumadin anticoagulation for stroke\nprevention.\n\n#. Urinary retention.  Has history of prostate cancer s/p\nbrachytherapy with history of subsequent urinary retention.\nPatient was started on flomax, and to continue at home\n\nMedications on Admission:\nFlomax 0.4 mg qhs\nCarvedilol 6.25mg [**Hospital1 **]\nDiltiazem XT 240mg [**Hospital1 **]\nDuo nebs (last [**Month (only) 462**])\nSpiriva (has not filled since [**Month (only) 462**])\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

He was initially found to\n   be 84% on RA.  At home, he is supposed to be on 2LNC as needed, though\n   he reports he wasn't using it recently.  He was given 125 mg IV of\n   methylprednisolone, albuterol neb, and moxifloxacin at OSH.  He was\n   then transferred to [**Hospital1 **] per family request.  Over the last two weeks,\n   he reports increasing SOB.  He denies fevers, chills, productive\n   cough.  Per patient's wife, he always has some non-productive\n   coughing.  He has has intermittent chest pain versus SOB for 2 years.\n   He is unable to characterize the pain.  He denies associated nausea,\n   vomiting, diaphoresis.  CP is not exertional.\n   In the ED, vitals were T 97.9, HR 108, BP 216/81, RR 16, 87% on 3LNC.\n   He was given a 50% ventimask, albuterol neb, and ceftriaxone.\n   .\n   Upon arrival to the MICU, patient is tachypneic with increased work of\n   breathing.  He denies chest pain at present.

No atrial septal defect is seen by\n   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The\n   left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Overall left ventricular\n   systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests\n   a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no\n   ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular free wall is\n   hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed\n   free wall contractility. There is abnormal systolic septal\n   motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.\n   There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve\n   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.\n   Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are\n   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral\n   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly\n   thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.\n   There is no pericardial effusion.\n   .\n   Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for\n   review) of [**2184-11-15**], the right ventricle is now dilated and\n   hypocontractile.

Respiratory failure.  Patient is known to have COPD, s/p\n   pneumothorax x 2 treated with pleuradesis.  No prior PFTs in our\n   records.  His blood gasses show significant hypercarbia and there is\n   wheezing on exam, making COPD exacerbation the most likely diagnosis.\n   However, will cover for pneumonia with ceftaz/levaquin given patients\n   cough and CXR.  Will diurese gently in case there is an element of CHF\n   though this seems less likely given normal BNP.

HTN.  Patient has HTN.  Was previously on metoprolol and diltiazem\n   at unclear doses.  However, patient unclear as to what medications he\n   currently takes and his pharmacy (CVS in [**Location (un) 1714**] (zip code [**Numeric Identifier 4587**]) is\n   currently closed.\n   - metoprolol IV 5 q 4 hours and titrate as needed for HR and BP\n   control; will transition to orals when diet is advanced\n   .\n   3.  PAF.  Patient has a history of PAF.  Currently in NSR.  Not\n   currently antocoagulated.\n   - continue BB\n   - continue monitor on tele\n   - aspirin\n   .\n   4. Urinary retention.
