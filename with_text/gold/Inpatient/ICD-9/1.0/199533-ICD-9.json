Also has large ulcers in inguinal areas\nL>R (6cm ulcer with pus and drainage in L inguinal area, 1cm\nulcer in R), she does dressing changes for these daily at home\nusing Silvedene. Inguinal ulcers are [**3-1**] heroin injection, pt\nreports she has not injected in about 6 months and ulcers have\nimproved since then.

No spontaneous\necho contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium\nor left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast or\nthrombus is seen in the body of the right atrium or the right\natrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color\nDoppler. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.\nOverall left ventricular systolic function is moderately\ndepressed (LVEF= 30-35 %). The right ventricular cavity is\nmildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There\nis a mass in the right ventricle. The ascending, transverse and\ndescending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of\natherosclerotic plaque to XX cm from the incisors. The diameters\nof aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no\naortic valve stenosis. Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral\nregurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There are\nno echocardiographic signs of tamponade.\n\nPOSR CPB:\n1. Improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolci function with inotropic\nsupport\n2. Bioprosthetic valve in aortic p[osition. Well seated and good\nleaflet excursion (PG =30 mm Hg\n3. RV mass in the subvalvular apparatus is still visible\n4. No other change\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nPt is 46 yo F with hx of IVDU, HCV, hx of cellulitis and\nosteomyelitis who p/w chronic non-healing ulcers [**3-1**] heroin use\nb/l and fever, found to have MSSA bacteremia and aortic valve\nendocarditis.\n.\n# MSSA Bacteremia - blood cultures ([**3-3**]) bottles from admission\npositive for MSSA. The most likely source is the bilateral\nchronic non-healing ulcers [**3-1**] heroin use. Though pt reports not\nhaving used heroin in the past 6 months, ulcers have not healed\ndespite dressing changes at home. On admission, ulcers appeared\ninfected and pt was febrile. Pt was started on IV nafcillin for\nMSSA, to complete a total 6-week course. Of note, pt has history\nof MSSA infections in the past (abscesses, bacteremia, and R\nsided endocarditis) for which she completed nafcillin courses.\nPt also had history of thoracic osteomyelitis in [**2144**] treated at\n[**Hospital1 2025**], though this was considered as possible source of bacteremia\non this admission, it seems less likely given no clinical\nsymptoms of back pain and more likely source of ulcers. Pt\nrefused MRI imaging, but should consider outpatient open MRI if\ndoes not continue to have improvement. All surveillance cultures\nsince admission have had no growth to date. As described below,\npt was found to have aortic valve vegetation and infective\nendocarditis with no abscess seen on TEE.\n.\n# Endocarditis - in setting of MSSA bacteremia, pt was found to\nhave 1.4cm vegetation on aortic valve, new since echo in [**3-9**],\nwith moderate aortic insufficiency. Started on 6-week course of\nIV nafcillin as above. Cardiology and CT surgery were consulted\nand did not recommend acute surgical intervention given\nbacteremia and no decompensated heart function. Daily ECGs did\nnot show any abnormalities, pt had hypotension to SBP 100\nthroughout most of hospital stay and one episode of fever to\n100.5 a week into therapy; given this, a TEE was done to\nevaluate for cardiac abscess and was negative for this.\n-Patient was transferred into MICU after code was called on\nfloors for hypoxic respiratory failure.  This respiratory\nfailure was quickly reversed with diuresis and NIMV, and was\nthought to be [**3-1**] severe aortic valve insufficiency in the\nsetting of patient anxiety.  Similar episodes occurred\nintermittently in the ICU with any mild increase in SVR, so\npatient was kept with sedative/opiate regimen to stave off\nanxiety.  Cardiac surgery was consulted, and it was agreed that\nsurgical correction of valve was only viable therapeutic option.\n.\n# Inguinal ulcers - [**3-1**] long-standing heroin use though pt\nreports no use for past 6 months. She had been doing daily\ndressing changes at home though these ulcers were likely\ninfected on admission (6x6cm in L anterior thigh area, 2x2cm in\nR). Wound care and plastic surgery were consulted, plastic\nsurgery did not recommend surgical debriding, pt had wet-to-dry\ndressing changes three times a day which required 1mg IV\ndilaudid for pain control beforehand. Once pt completes\nantibiotic course for bacteremia and endocarditis, she will\nfollow up with plastic surgery to consider flap placement to\nensure healing. Pt had bilateral venous stasis changes and 1+\nedema below knees, in addition to leg elevation and\nbetamethasone cream, she was diuresed with lasix and had\ndecrease in edema and pain in legs.\n.\n# Acute renal insufficiency - likely pre-renal given poor PO\nintake recently and infection. Cr improved to 1.3 today, FeNa\n2.5% and FeUrea 52% both of which suggest resolution of\npre-renal state\n- encourage PO intake\n- continue to trend Cr\n.\n# Hypotension - now improved, SBP 110s-120s. Given aortic valve\nvegetation, will maintain high suspicion for valve dysfunction\ncontributing to hypotension.\n- encourage PO intake\n- monitor on tele, daily ECGs\n- continue abx as above\n.\n# Anemia - chronic, HCT baseline 26-27, [**Month/Day (2) **] studies in [**2145**]\nrevealed likely etiology as anemia of chronic inflammation. [**Year (4 digits) **]\npanel indicates likely ACI, no evidence for hemolysis. HCT\nbumped appropriately to 1U RBC. HCT stable today.\n- T+S, PIV\n- peripheral smear - no schistocytes\n- B12 / folate - normal\n.\n# Anxiety - continue home 1mg TID ativan\n.\n# HCV - \"inactive\", never treated for this. Pt had liver biopsy\nin [**6-6**] which showed fibrosis with no clear etiology for\nhepatomegaly. She follows in [**Hospital **] clinic here. Recent poor\nappetite and weight loss is concerning for malignancy, though\nAFP not elevated.\n- outpt work-up for ?malignancy\n- LFTs stable\n\n# IVDU - pt reports being clean for 6 months\n- social work consult\nMICU Course\nThe patient is a 46 yo F with hx of IVDU complicated by MSSA\nverebral osteo [**2143**], and prior history of endocarditis [**2145**] at\n[**Hospital1 2025**], h/o MRSA/pseudomonal hip wound infection, HCV,\ngranulomatous disease of GI tract, chronic inguinal ulcers, and\nanxiety with MSSA endocarditis who was transferred to the MICU\nfor hypercarpic respiratory failure and code blue after being\nbriefly unresponsive.\n.\n#. Hypercarpic Respiratory Failure:  Pt initial ABG showed ph\n6.84 and PCO2 of 112.  The differential for her respiratory\nfailure was medication related especially opioid use causing\nrespiratory depression. Although pt with high tolerance and has\nbeen stable on dilaudid dosing and no recent increase.  The\npatient does have a history of drug abuse and could have had an\nalternate source of drugs or been hording her medications.  Pt\nalso could have fallen because of a seizure with head injury\nleading to bleed or embolic/hemorrhagic stroke given\nendocarditis, but pt awake and interactive making major CNS\nprocess unlikely.  Pt does not have a history of COPD or other\nhistory of bronchospasm.  CXR did not show clear evidence of\nacute pathology.  LENIs performed yesterday negative for DVT,\nmaking PE less likely.  Pt was extubated after being intubated\nfor 2 days and sating well on 2L NC/RA.\n.\n#. MSSA Endocarditis: Pt previously on Nafcillin for MSSA\nendocarditis seen on TEE.  Pt had stat ECHO performed at bedside\nby cardiology  ID consulted and recommended changing to\nvancomycin and meropenem given concern for sepsis upon initial\npresentation to ICU, which was later switched back to Nafcillin\ngiven stable BP's and clinical status, as this provides better\ncoverage of her MSSA bacteremia.Follow-up blood, urine and\nsputum cultures\n.\n\n# Hypotension: Likely [**3-1**] cardiogenic shock given markedly\ndecreased EF.  Sepsis was initially also a concern in this pt\nwith MSSA endocarditis but given mixed venous of < 70,\ncardiogenic is more likely. Required briefly phenylephrine but\nwas later weaned off and tolerated well without.  TTE repeated\nyesterday showed EF 40%, worsening AR.  Was transfused 2 units\nof PRBC's.\n.\n#. ECG Changes: Pt with inverted t-waves in the setting of her\nsevere acidosis and tachycardia.  Troponin peaked at 0.27 and\ntrended down at 0.22.  Per cardiology, will not pursue\nanticoagulation for concern of ACS , according to ECHO report\npatient most likely experienced coronary artery embolization\nfrom her endocarditis\n.\n#. S/p Fall: Pt found down for undetermined time. She is\ncurrently complaining of neck pain.  MRI of the cervial and\nthoracic spine was unremarkable and trauma surgery cleared the\npatient.\n.\n# Inguinal ulcers - [**3-1**] long-standing heroin use.  No evidence\nof infection and was being followed by plastics.\n\n- wound care with wet to dry dressings TID\n\n.\n\n# HCV - Never underwent treatment. Pt had liver biopsy in [**6-6**]\nwhich showed fibrosis with no clear etiology for hepatomegaly.\nTrended LFTs Q daily\n.\n# IVDU - pt reports being clean for 6-8 months per prior notes\n.Social work following\n.\n#[**Last Name (un) **]??????Cr elevated to 1.6 from low of 1.1 a few days ago.  [**Month (only) 116**] be\nhypoperfusion [**3-1**] cardiogenic shock.  UA also positive; may have\nthrown septic emboli to kidneys. Urine lytes showed a boderline\nprerenal etiology with Fe urea 28%.

However, given respiratory\nfailure after receiving dilaudid and ativan, will be\nconservative in dosing, ordered Lorazepam 1 mg PO/NG Q6H:PRN\nanxiety , HYDROmorphone (Dilaudid) 0.5-1 mg IV Q3H:PRN\npain/agitation\n.\n#Anemia: Hct drop from 27 to 22 this morning, 20 on repeat.\nTransfused 2 units PRBCs,did not increase appropiately to first\nunit and DIC labs were sent which were unremarkable, Guiac\nstools...\n\nCardiac Surgery Course:\nThe patient was brought to the operating room on [**2146-12-21**] where\nthe patient underwent aortic valve replacement with 23mm Porcine\ntissue valve.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well\nand post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable\ncondition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  The patient\nremained intubated on POD 1 as she had no cuff leak and had been\nintubated multiple times during this admission, and it was\ndecided to manage her conservatively.  She remained on\nepinephrine and propofol drips. Decadron was initiated for lack\nof cuff leak on POD 2.\nPOD 3 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and\nbreathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact\nand hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and\nvasopressor support.  Acute pain service was consulted, as she\nhas a h/o IVDA and refused MS Contin or Oxycontin.\nRecommendations were made for dilaudid.  ID continued to follow\nand the patient is to be maintained on Nafcillin for a 6 week\ncourse through [**2147-1-9**].  PICC was placed to facilitate therapy.\n Fluconazole was initiated for yeast in the urine.  Beta blocker\nwas initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the\npreoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the\ntelemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing\nwires were discontinued without complication.
