Found to have extensive DVT and acute on\n   chronic RF.  Was started on heparin gtt and yesterday was noted to have\n   a right facial droop and increased dysarthria, R-sided weakness and\n   somnolence.  He developed what appeared to be a R-sided seizure and\n   then a grand-mal seizure in the CT scanner at the OSH.  He was\n   intubated for airway protection and transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] to the\n   neurosurgery service.  He was noted to be hypotensive after intubation\n   (without sedation) prior to transfer and was started on neo.  An aline\n   was placed also prior to transfer.\n   .\n   This morning, the neurosurgery attending asked that the MICU take over\n   his care given the complexity of his medical problems.\n   .\n   On eval, he was intubated and sedated.  Does not follow commands.  Not\n   on sedation although received 2 mg of IV ativan within the past 2 hours\n   for possible seizure.\n   .\n   Per his son who is at his bedside, he was doing well until about 2\n   months ago at which point they noticed a 15 pound weight loss and\n   hematuria.  Bladder cancer was discovered and he had a cystoscopic\n   removal of tumor.  2 weeks ago, his son noted that he was increasingly\n   tired w/ decreased appetite and LE swelling.  He fell and hit his head\n   about 1 week ago but his son noticed only a small cut and so did not\n   have him evaluated.

It is\n   consistent with a predominantly acute subdural hematoma. This exerts\n   mass effect upon the left hemisphere, predominantly in the frontal and\n   temporal lobes, with effacement\n   of the underlying cerebral sulci and mild left frontal edema. There is\n   a mild rightward shift of the anterior falx, septum pellucidum and\n   third ventricle. There is mild mass effect upon the left lateral\n   ventricle. No intraventricular hemorrhagic extension and no parenchymal\n   hemorrhage is identified. Prominence of the cerebral sulci is\n   compatible with age-related involutional change. Periventricular\n   regions of hypodensity are compatible with chronic microvascular\n   ischemic change. No fracture is identified. The paranasal sinuses and\n   mastoid air cells are well aerated.

Found to have extensive DVT\nand acute on chronic RF. Was started on heparin gtt and\nyesterday was noted to have a right facial droop and increased\ndysarthria, R-sided weakness and somnolence. He developed what\nappeared to be a R-sided seizure and then a grand-mal seizure in\nthe CT scanner at the OSH. He was intubated for airway\nprotection and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to the neurosurgery service.\nHe was noted to be hypotensive after intubation (without\nsedation) prior to transfer and was started on neo. An aline was\nplaced also prior to transfer.\n.\nThis morning, the neurosurgery attending asked that the MICU\ntake over his care given the complexity of his medical problems.\n\n.\nOn eval, he was intubated and sedated. Does not follow commands.\nNot on sedation although received 2 mg of IV ativan within the\npast 2 hours for possible seizure.\n.\nPer his son who is at his bedside, he was doing well until about\n2 months ago at which point they noticed a 15 pound weight loss\nand hematuria. Bladder cancer was discovered and he had a\ncystoscopic removal of tumor. 2 weeks ago, his son noted that he\nwas increasingly tired w/ decreased appetite and LE swelling. He\nfell and hit his head about 1 week ago but his son noticed only\na small cut and so did not have him evaluated. Over the week\nprior to admission, he became unable to walk and needed a\nwheelchair to get around.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nHTN\nthoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysm\nh/o transitional cell bladder cancer\nCKD\nh/o lumbar laminectomy\ntertiary hyperparathyroidism\nBPH\nDVT in the past, s/p IVC filter placement\nbilateral cataracts s/p removal\nglaucoma\ns/p L TKR\n?[**Name (NI) **] unclear per records\nPVD ?

It is consistent with a predominantly acute\nsubdural hematoma. This exerts mass effect upon the left\nhemisphere, predominantly in the frontal and temporal lobes,\nwith effacement of the underlying cerebral sulci and mild left\nfrontal edema. There is a mild rightward shift of the anterior\nfalx, septum pellucidum and third ventricle.\nThere is mild mass effect upon the left lateral ventricle. No\nintraventricular hemorrhagic extension and no parenchymal\nhemorrhage is\nidentified.\nProminence of the cerebral sulci is compatible with age-related\ninvolutional change. Periventricular regions of hypodensity are\ncompatible with chronic microvascular ischemic change.\nNo fracture is identified. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air\ncells are\nwell aerated. The orbits are unremarkable. Endotracheal and\nnasogastric\ntubes are noted.\n\nIMPRESSION: Large acute subdural hematoma along the convexity\nand tentorium, with mass effect as described above.\n.\nCT Head on [**1-21**] for follow up:\nFINDINGS: An evolving subdural hematoma along the left cerebral\nconvexity\nagain likely extends along the left tentorium cerebelli.\nMinimal, 1 mm,\nrightward midline shift is unchanged. Ventricular and sulcal\ncaliber is\nunchanged and no new intracranial hemorrhage is identified.\nModerate-to-severe periventricular white matter hypodensity is\nconsistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes.\nAtherosclerotic calcifications involve the cavernous carotids\nand intracranial vertebral arteries bilaterally. The imaged\nportions of the paranasal sinuses appear well aerated.\n\nIMPRESSION: Evolving left cerebral convexity subdural hematoma\nwith unchanged minimal mass effect, stable compared to the CT\nfrom [**1-18**].\n.\nMRI Head:\nFINDINGS: Areas of slow flow and restricted diffusion are seen\nin the right posterior parietal periatrial region with high\nsignal on diffusion images and low signal on ADC map indicative\nof acute infarcts. Small acute infarcts are also seen in right\nparietal and left frontal lobes.\nThere is subacute subdural hematoma identified extending from\nfrontal to\noccipital region on the left with a maximum width of\napproximately 1.5 cm to 2 cm at the convexity with indentation\non the sulci. Increased signal along the sulci may indicate\nsmall amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage or stasis of the CSF\nsecondary to subdural. Small amount of subdural collection is\nalso seen along the left side of the tentorium. There is no\nmidline shift seen. Moderate to severe brain atrophy and\nmoderate changes of small vessel disease are identified. There\nis no midline shift. Sagittal T2 images were obtained to\nevaluate the brainstem, but are limited by motion. Changes of\ncervical spondylosis are visualized, which are further evaluated\nwith cervical spine\nMRI. Bilateral basal ganglia lacunes are seen.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Small areas of restricted diffusion in the left frontal lobe,\nright\nparietal lobe, and left periatrial region suggestive of embolic\ninfarcts.\n2. Left-sided subdural hematoma extending from frontal to\noccipital region\nwith obliteration of adjacent sulci. No midline shift. Brain\natrophy and\nsmall vessel disease.\n.\nMRI C-Spine\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Limited study due to motion. Multilevel degenerative change\nis seen.\n2. Moderate spinal stenosis at C4-5 and mild-to-moderate spinal\nstenosis at C5-6 and C6-7 with extrinsic indentation on the\nspinal cord.\n3. Postoperative changes with posterior bony bar at C3-4\nslightly indenting the spinal cord. Atrophic changes in the\nspinal cord at C3-4 level.\n.\nECHOs:\n[**1-8**]:\nThe left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses\nand cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left\nventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the\nbasal inferior and inferolateral walls. The remaining segments\ncontract normally (LVEF = 50 %). Right ventricular chamber size\nand free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly\ndilated. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. The\naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic\nstenosis is not present. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild\n(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are\nstructurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial\nmitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery\nsystolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild\nregional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA distribution).\nDilated ascending and descending thoracic aorta. Mild pulmonary\nartery systolic hypertension.\n.\n[**2-5**]:\nThe left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses\nand cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left\nventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the\ninferior and inferolateral walls. The remaining segments\ncontract normally (LVEF = 50 %). Right ventricular chamber size\nand free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly\ndilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but\naortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation\nis seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial\nmitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery\nsystolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-1-23**], a\nprominent left pleural effusion is now identified and the\nestimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is lower. Left\nventricular wall motion is similar.\n.\nLower Extremity Cath:\nCOMMENTS:\n1.  Access via LFA via 4F catheter.\n2.  Imaging of the distal aorta with a Omniflush catheter at L1\nrevealed\nmild aortic disease with no renal artery stenosis.  The iliacs\nwere very\ntortuous on both sides but without flow limiting lesions.  The\nCFA's\nwere without lesions.\n3.  Imaging of the right leg with a Slip cath in the right SFA\nrevealed\na mid SFA 10cm occlusion.  There was a high grade popliteal\nlesion and\nsingle vessel run off to the foot via a peroneal.   There was\nonly very\nfaint filling of plantars and DP.\n4. Referral to vascular surgery for right leg BKA.\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:\n1. Right SFA occlusion with severe infra-popliteal disease.\n.\nRenal US:\nIMPRESSION: Probably no hydronephrosis.\n.\nCT abdomen and Pelvis Follow up:\nFINDINGS\n100 cc of contrast was administered through G-tube. There is no\ncontrast\nextravasation. Extensive pneumoperitoneum is again noted.\nHowever, this is\nunchanged from the prior examination from the previous day.\n\nThere is bilateral pleural effusion, small in quantity, not\nsignificantly\nchanged from the prior study. The unenhanced liver and spleen\nappear\nunremarkable. There is bilateral hydronephrosis and mild\nhydroureter. This\nis likely on the basis of the significant wall thickening seen\nin the urinary bladder.\n\nAneurysmal abdominal aorta at the diaphragmatic crura is\nunchanged from prior study, with atherosclerotic changes.\n\nThe gallbladder appears dilated, though unchanged from the prior\nstudy.\n\nAgain noted is prominence of the left psoas muscle, with an area\nof\nhypodensity, which may represent fluid collection, however,\ninfection cannot be excluded.\n\nThere is no evidence of bowel dilatation.\n\nIVC filter is again noted. There are degenerative endplate\nchanges in the\nthoracolumbar spine.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\n1. No evidence for G-tube extravasation.\n\n2. No interval change in enlargement of the left psoas muscle\nwith hypodense collection in the left flank. While this may\nrepresent old hematoma, a loculated infected collection cannot\nbe excluded and intravenous contrast would be necessary for\nadditional evaluation.\n\n3. Again noted mild bilateral hydronephrosis, which is likely\nsecondary to\nsignificant bladder wall thickening.\n\n4. Unchanged pneumoperitoneum.\n.\nCT chest:\nIMPRESSION: Dilated ascending aorta and thoracoabdominal\njunction. Bilateral psoas hematoma, much larger on the left,\nextending in the retroperitoneum.\n.\nLabs on Discharge:\nCHMS ADDED 2253 [**2181-1-5**]\n141 / 107 / 51  162   AGap=17\n----------------\n4.2 / 21 / 3.6\nWBC 9.4, Hct 28.5, Plt 249\nall have been stable over the last several days\nestGFR: 16/20 (click for details)\nCK: 778  MB: 5  Trop-T: 0.12\nComments: cTropnT: Called [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 21654**],303am,[**2181-1-6**]\ncTropnT: Ctropnt > 0.10 Ng/Ml Suggests Acute Mi\nCa: 7.5 Mg: 1.9 P: 4.7\nALT: 32 AP: 46 Tbili: 1.1 Alb: 2.6\nAST: 45 LDH:  Dbili:  TProt:\n[**Doctor First Name **]: 44 Lip: 13\nSerum ASA, EtOH, Acetmnphn, Benzo, Barb, Tricyc Negative\nComments: Positive Tricyclic Results Represent Potentially Toxic\nLevels;Therapeutic Tricyclic Levels Will Typically Have Negative\nResults\nTSH:1.5 Free-T4:1.1\nPhenytoin: 14.7\nPT: 13.7  PTT: 27.6  INR: 1.2\nFibrinogen: 351\n.\nOf note in microbiology,\npt only grew [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans in urine, otherwise all cultures\nwere negative without any obvious organism.\n\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n85 year old gentleman with CRI, HTN, Bladder CA and known R [**Hospital **]\ntransferred from NEBH with Subdural Hematoma, Seizures, and new\nacute on chronic renal failure requiring dialysis.  He was\ntransfered to our Neurosurgical service then MICU for evaluation\nof altered mental status and sepsis.\n\n# Altered mental status:  AMS began with the development of a\nSDH after treatment of extensive LLE DVT with a heparin gtt.\nThe patient was transfered to the MICU on [**1-8**].\nNeurosurgery was the initial primary team (then consulting) and\nbased on family discussions and repeat head imaging no\nintervention was performed.  His neurologic status did improve\nover time, but persistent deficits lead to subsequent neurologic\nconsultation.  The following problems were addressed by the\nneurology team:\nfor his ENCEPHALOPATHY:  toxic-metabolic work up identified the\nfollowing possible etiologies: yeast UTI, PNA, R LE necrosis, L\nDVT, ESRD on HD. His sedating medications were limited.  A\nrepeat routine EEG demonstrated no evidence of subclinical sz\nactivity.  MRI of the brain, however, demonstrated small areas\nof restricted diffusion in the left frontal love, right parietal\nlove, and left periatal region suggestive of embolic infarcts;\nimproving SDH.\nfor his STROKES: MRI of the brain demonstrated actute embolic\ninfarcts.  A subsequent TTE on [**1-23**] demonstrated regional left\nventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery\ndisease. A left atrial/ [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1916**] thrombus cannot be excluded\nby TTE. If clinically indicated, a TEE would better assess for\nthis possibility. No significant change from prior. Carotid\nultrasound noted: Less than 40% stenosis in the right and left\ninternal carotid arteries.  MRA was held due to concern for\nacute on chronic renal disease.  The patient was placed on ASA\nto treat the embolic strokes after consultation with\nneurosurgery.\nfor his QUADRAPARESIS:  MRI of the C-spine: Multilevel\ndegenerative change is seen, with Moderate spinal stenosis at\nC4-5 and mild-to-moderate spinal stenosis at C5-6 and C6-7 with\nextrinsic indentation on the spinal cord, and postoperative\nchanges with posterior bony bar at C3-4 slightly indenting the\nspinal cord. Atrophic changes in the spinal cord at C3-4 level.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the MICU minimally responsive to\nstimuli on intermittent ativan.  He was intubated for airway\nprotection and maintained on pressure support with minimal\nrequirements.  His altered mental status was attributed to a\ncombination of new subdural hematoma, which remained stable\nthroughout admission, and resulting seizure activity.  On\ntransfer he is responsive to questions with the appropriateness\nof his garbled answers uncertain.\n\nAs treatment for the seizures, he was started on keppra and\nshould be continued on this until neurology follow up is\narranged.  The dose is keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **].\n\n#. Subdural hematoma:  After discovery of an extensive DVT of\nthe LLE at an OSH, the patient was started on a heparin gtt.  He\nsubsequently developed right facial droop and increased\ndysarthria, R-sided weakness and somnolence. He developed what\nappeared to be a R-sided seizure and then a grand-mal seizure in\nthe CT scanner at the OSH.  He was intubated for airway\nprotection and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to the neurosurgery service.\nHe was noted to be hypotensive after intubation (without\nsedation) prior to transfer and was started on neo. Heparin was\nstopped due to head bleed and IVC Filter placed. The patient\ndeveloped a subdural hematoma at the outside hospital presumed\nsecondary to heparin therapy for a DVT.  Neurosurgery was the\ninitial primary team (then consulting) and based on family\ndiscussions and repeat head imaging no intervention was\nperformed.  The hematomas were stable on transfer.  See below\nfor seizure treatment related to hematoma.\n.\n# Seizures:  The patient developed right sided seizures likely\ndue to his subdural hematoma as confirmed by EEG and neuro\nconsult. The patient was started on ativan, dilantin, and keppra\nfor seizure control.  He will be tapered off of dilantin,\ntransitioned to Keppra and the ativan held.\n.\n# Acute on Chronic renal failure:  Acute on chronic kidney\nfailure likely due to contrast induced nephropathy, despite\npretreatment with IVF and bicarb.  The patient was admitted with\ntemporary HD line in place after 3 days of HD.  He was seen by\nour renal service and dialyzed once through the temporary line\nwith no further indication for dialysis at the time of transfer.\n The patient developed a fever of unknown origin, and the\ntemperary HD line was pulled due to concern that it would be\nseeded by infection.  He subsequently developed fluid overload,\nresistent to medical therapy.  Nephrology then saw him and\nplaced a permanent HD line, and received regular HD.  He\ndevelops moderated hypotension during HD but was otherwise\nasymptomatic.  The plan is to continue Monday and Thursday\ndialysis indefinitely for now.  The renal team will directly\ncontact the receiving rehab facility about dialysis information.\n.\n# Pneumonia:  Gram [**Last Name (un) **] suggestive of infection treated with 7\ndays of Vanc/Zosyn followed by Unasyn with a resolution of white\ncount and no fevers early in the admission.  He did have another\ninfection of unclear source which resulted in sepsis and a\nsecond transfer to the MICU.  See below for details of that\ninfection.\n.\n# Right toe eschar-unable to palpate, + Doppler pulses and\nconcern is for arterial insufficiency.  Vascular\nconsulted-follow recs suggested nitropaste only, no intervention\ngiven bleed and contraindication for heparin.  Due to\nintermittant hypotension, the nitropaste was discontinued.  He\nwent for catheterization, which demonstrated severe, diffuse\ndisease, not amenable to stenting.  Due to prior SDH, patient\nwas not a candidate for anticoagulation.  Prelim report on US\nshowed SFA occlusion with reconstitution distal to popliteal.\n.\n#. DVT: The patient was found to have extensive DVT and acute on\nchronic RF.  Was started on heparin gtt and subsequently\ndeveloped a SDH.  The heparin was stopped and an IVC filter was\nplaced in [**Doctor Last Name 2434**].  He does not have signs of PE with good\noxygenation on room air.\n.\n# Hematuria: insetting of change of [**Last Name (un) 21655**] and [**Last Name (un) 21655**] care. The\npatient also has a history of bladder cancer; urology saw\npatient earlier in admission.  Several U/As were positive for\nyeast infection.  The patient had a prolonged course of oral\nfluconazole and topical miconazole.  The yeast infection cleared\non subsequent U/A.  But per urology recs, he is to complete a 14\nday course of fluconazole.  The end date of fluconazole is 11\ndays from day of discharge on [**2-17**].  He should not have his foley\nchanged once at rehab as it was placed with cystoscopy and is a\ndifficult change.  He should follow up with urology in 2 weeks\nafter his fluconazole is completed for reevaluation of need for\nfoley.  In setting of ARF, he does still make small amounts of\nurine.\n.\n# Inability to swollow: Possibly multifactorial with left sided\nSDH and acute embolic areas of infarction, in addition to severe\ncervical spinal stenosis.  Speach and swallow evaluation\noccurred on more than one occasion, and he was unable to protect\nhis airway, and did not have a gag reflex.  After a significant\namount of time with an NG tube, and multiple conversations with\nthe Son, her received a G-tube.  He is receiving tube feeds and\nreached his goal rate.\n.\n# Hypotension developed within two days of G-tube placement and\nin the setting of penile instrumentation. Etiology could be from\na number of cuases including bleeding in the setting of his\nrecent G-tube placement, hypovolemia, perhaps increased vagal\ntone from bladder distention, sepsis from gangrenous foot, and\nACS.  A CT of his abdomen demonstrated a fluid collection that\nwas not consistent with blood by [**Doctor Last Name **], but could not differentiate\nbetween sterile fluid collection or an abscess without contrast.\n The patient received fluid boluses, narcan to reverse the\npotential effects of the 1mg of i.v. morphine the patient\nreceived.  In addition, the patient had blood and urine\ncultures.  The urine culture wa positive for bacteria and >50\nWBCs, > 50 RBCs.  The patient remained persistently hypotensive\ndespite IVF and was transferred to the MICU for concern for\nurosepsis.  See below for MICU course.\n.\n# Anemia: Hct 25.5 in setting of hemodilution and hematuria-no\nfurther hematuria overnight after foley replaced by urology.\nIron studies were obtained and were consistent with anemia of\nchronic disease.  The HCT remained stable.\n.\n# Thrombocytopenia: Resolved.\n_____________________________________________\nMICU admission [**Date range (1) 21656**]: Patient was transferred to MICU on\n[**2-3**] for hypotension in the setting of concern for sepsis with a\npossible complication of the G-tube placement. Imaging did not\nshow problems with the G tube placement and patient became\nafebrile and resolved leukocytosis on vanc/zosyn/fluconazole.\nSurgery followed and determined that the G tube was safe to use.\nPressures were MAP>60 and SBP in 90s, higher than pressures on\nadmission. Pressure throughout the course of hospitalization\nhave not been greater than SBP 110.\n.\n# Sepsis - his hypotension that resulted in transfer to the MICU\nwas likely urosepsis, although no organism was ever grown in\nculture.  Other sources could have been the intraabdominal fluid\ncollection, although surgery consulted and did not think it was\nan infection.  He responded to a course of vanco and zosyn and\nshould complete a two week course of the antibiotics.  The end\ndate is [**2-12**].  He had a midline placed for abx\nadministration.  He recovered quickly without any need for\npressure support.  He was not dialyzed during this time because\nof his hypotension, but has been dialyzed the last two days\nprior to discharge and was run even.  He maintained his BPs\nduring this time.\n.\n# Pneumoperitoneum on CT scan - during imaging while working up\nhis hypotension, CT revealed pneumoperitoneum around the G tube\nplacement.  He had a benign abdomen exam and it was not thought\nto be cause of his hypotension.  His tube feeds were initially\nheld, but with surgery following along were restarted several\ndays prior to discharge.  He quickly reached goal and did not\nhave high residuals.\n.\n# SVT - The day prior to discharge, the patient developed [**4-18**]\ntransient episodes of SVT with rates of 140.  The episodes last\napproximately 1-20 minutes and were asymptomatic to the patient.\n He maintained a normal blood pressure during these episodes.\nMost of the episodes broke with vagal manuevers or with a\nspontaneous PVC.  We started diltiazem for rate control at a\nvery low dose as to not drop his blood pressures.  He tolerated\nthe diltiazem well and should be continued on it.\n.\nIN SUMMARY:\n85 y/o M who presented after anticoagulated DVT resulted in SDH.\n Also found to have old strokes, now with resultant\nquadraparesis.  Had seizures that were treated with keppra.\nAlso initially had a pneumonia, s/p treatment.  While receiving\nimaging during workup of these above issues developed acute on\nchronic renal failure and started on HD, now due for Monday and\nThursday dialysis.  Had workup of ischemic feet, showed diseased\nvasculature, but no intervention done.  No infection of necrotic\ntoes.  Was recovering well but after G tube placement had\nhypotension likely from sepsis of unclear etiology, although\nurine most likely source.  Has known yeast infection in bladder;\nurology following and has permanent foley cath in.  Is being\ntreated with vanco and zosyn and fluconazole for sepsis.  Had\nSVTs treated with diltiazem.\n.\nSo, once at rehab, he should continue his antibiotic course of\nvanco, zosyn and fluconazole.  He can start PT/OT.  He should\nfollow up with neuro, urology and his PCP.\n\nMedications on Admission:\noxycodone\nCalcitrol\nPrilosec\nMentax\navocat\nFlomax\nTimoptic\nTravatan\nDyazide\nvitamin D\nVitamin B12\n.\nOn transfer:\nLorazepam 2 mg IV ONCE Duration: 1 Doses Order date: [**1-5**] @\n[**2115**]\nIV access: Temporary central access (ICU) Location: Left\nSubclavian, Date inserted: [**2181-1-5**] Order date: [**1-5**] @ 2124\nLorazepam 1-5 mg IV Q4H seizure activity hold if oversedated\nOrder date: [**1-6**] @ 0820\n1000 mL NS Continuous at 80 ml/hr Order date: [**1-5**] @ [**2183**]\nMagnesium Sulfate 2 gm IV ONCE Duration: 1 Doses Order date:\n[**1-6**] @ 0428\n1000 mL NS Bolus 1000 ml Over 60 mins Order date: [**1-5**] @ 2250\nNorepinephrine 0.03-0.25 mcg/kg/min IV DRIP TITRATE TO SBP >\n100mmHg Order date: [**1-5**] @ [**2183**]\n500 mL NS Bolus 500 ml Over 30 mins Order date: [**1-5**] @ 2149\nPantoprazole 40 mg IV Q24H Order date: [**1-5**] @ [**2183**]\n500 mL NS Bolus 500 ml Over 30 mins Order date: [**1-5**] @ 2149\nPhenytoin 100 mg IV Q8H Hold am dose until trough level back.\nOrder date: [**1-5**] @ 2250\nAcetaminophen 650 mg PR Q4H:PRN fever or pain Order date: [**1-5**]\n@ [**2183**]\nPiperacillin-Tazobactam Na 2.25 g IV ONCE Duration: 1 Doses\n*Awaiting ID Approval* ID Approval is required for this order.\nOrder date: [**1-6**] @ 0058\n8.
