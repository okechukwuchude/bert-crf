No atrial septal\ndefect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is\nnormal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There\nare simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple\natheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three\naortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace\naortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is\nseen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is\nnormal. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was\nnotified in person of the results at time of surgery.\n\nPOST-BYPASS: The patient is A paced. The patient is on a\nphenylephrine infusion. Biventricular function is unchanged.\nMitral regurgitation is unchanged. Tricuspid regurgitation is\nmoderate (2+). The aorta is intact post-decannulation.\n\n[**2137-4-22**] 04:17AM BLOOD WBC-9.2 RBC-2.84* Hgb-8.3* Hct-26.9*\nMCV-95 MCH-29.3 MCHC-31.0 RDW-13.8 Plt Ct-287\n[**2137-4-21**] 04:52AM BLOOD Hct-26.2*\n[**2137-4-20**] 11:26PM BLOOD Hct-25.9*\n[**2137-4-22**] 04:17AM BLOOD Glucose-97 UreaN-14 Creat-0.8 Na-137\nK-4.3 Cl-103 HCO3-29 AnGap-9\n[**2137-4-21**] 04:52AM BLOOD UreaN-15 Creat-0.8\n[**2137-4-20**] 02:51AM BLOOD Glucose-122* UreaN-11 Creat-0.9 Na-138\nK-4.4 Cl-105 HCO3-25 AnGap-12\n[**2137-4-19**] 02:52AM BLOOD Glucose-118* UreaN-9 Creat-0.5 Na-135\nK-4.0 Cl-105 HCO3-23 AnGap-11\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2137-4-18**] where\nthe patient underwent CABG x 3 with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. Initial attempt\nat endoscopic approach was aborted and converted to open CABG.\nOverall the patient tolerated the procedure well and\npost-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable\ncondition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  Left sided\nchest tube was placed for pleural effusion via endoscopic port\nsite on post operative night before extubation.  POD 1 found the\npatient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.\nThe patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically\nstable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support. POD 1 OR\nchest tubes were removed and left chest tube remained in place.\nShe has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation which she had\npreoperatively but was in sinus rhtyhm at the time of discharge\nand was not anticoagulated. Beta blocker was initiated at a low\ndose with SBP 90's and the patient was gently diuresed toward\nthe preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the\ntelemetry floor for further recovery.  Left Chest tube was\nremoved at this time  and pacing wires were discontinued without\ncomplication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy\nservice for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time\nof discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, she was\nhemodynamically stable in sinus rhythm, the wound was healing\nand pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was\ndischarged home with VNA services in good condition with\nappropriate follow up instructions.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nASPIRIN 81 mg Daily\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. magnesium hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30)\nML PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.\n2. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\n3. ranitidine HCl 150 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2\ntimes a day) for 1 months.\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n4. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q4H (every\n4 hours) as needed for pain, fever.\n5. metoprolol tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n6. potassium chloride 20 mEq Tablet, ER Particles/Crystals Sig:\nOne (1) Tablet, ER Particles/Crystals PO once a day for 7 days.\nDisp:*7 Tablet, ER Particles/Crystals(s)* Refills:*0*\n7. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
