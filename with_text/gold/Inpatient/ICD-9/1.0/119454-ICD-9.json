He was treated with levaquin and then changed\nto CTX/azithro/flagyl and subsequently transferred to ICU for\nhypoxia thought to be due to acute heart failure. TTE showed\npreserved systolic function but did show moderate RV dilation so\na CTA chest was done which was negative for PE.

Left ventricular\nwall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate\nregional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid- to\ndistal anterior and anteroseptal hypokinesis. The remaining\nsegments contract normally (LVEF = 35%). Right ventricular\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve\nleaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not\npresent. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral\nvalve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve\nprolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.\nThere is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Severe\npulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial\neffusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic\ndysfunction, c/w LAD disease. Mild to moderate mitral\nregurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.\n\nCXR ([**2-21**]): Asymmetrically distributed pulmonary edema improved\nsubstantially between [**2-19**] and [**2-20**] and heart size decreased.\nAllowing for lower lung volumes, there has been no subsequent\nchange. Since 8:10 p.m. on [**2-20**] more confluent areas of\npulmonary abnormality in the axillary subsegments of the right\nupper lobe and right lung base posteriorly, could be pneumonia\nbut could also be asymmetric edema and atelectasis, particularly\nthe latter. There is no appreciable pleural effusion. ET tube is\nin standard placement. Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach. No\npneumothorax.\n\nCXR ([**2-23**]):  In comparison with the study of [**2-22**], there is\ncontinued elevation of pulmonary venous pressure with\natelectasis at the left base medially.\n\nVideo swallow study ([**2-24**]): ****\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n88 year old male with CAD s/p CABG, remote smoking history,\natrial fibrillation, [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with\nhypoxia after being treated for a CAP\n.\n# Hypoxia: Initially intubated given difficulty with\noxygenation. TTE revealed regional akinesis and hypokinesis, as\nwell as LVEF 35%, possibly attributable to acute heart failure.\nHe was placed on furosemide gtt but was intermittently held for\nhypotension. Was placed on empiric antibiotics for CAP. Was\nevaluated by Speech & Swallow therapy, and was believed to be\naspirating as well has collecting significant pharyngeal\nresidue, to which he was insensate. This was potentially\nsecondary to irritation of his oropharynx from his brief\nintubation. His hypoxia improved greatly, and it was felt that\nhis swallow would likely recover over time.  A dobhoff was\nplaced for temporary nutrition and med administration.  ****\n.\n# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Placed on diltiazem gtt for rate\ncontrol. Amiodarone was initially held for concern for\namiodarone-induced pneumonitis, but this was eventually\nrestarted. Warfarin was restarted on [**2-21**]. Dilt was switched\nover to PO and increased to 60qd with good rate control.  At\ndishcarge his home dose of verapamil SR was restarted.\n.\n# CAD s/p CABG/CHF:  Added lisinopril to home regimen.****\n.\n# HTN: Well controlled on home regimen.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nAmiodarone 200 mg daily.\nAccupril 5 mg daily.\nUrsodiol 300 mg t.i.d.\nLevothyroxine 25 mcg daily.\nSulfadiazine 100 mg b.i.d.\nCoumadin.\nVerapamil SR 180 mg daily.\nXalatan eye drops.\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Verapamil SR 180 mg Tablet Sustained Release Sig: One (1)\nTablet Sustained Release PO twice a day.\n\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExtended Care\n\nFacility:\n[**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nMultifocal Pneumonia\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status:Clear and coherent\nLevel of Consciousness:Alert and interactive\nActivity Status:Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker\nor cane)\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\n\nYou were transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for better managment of your\nlow oxgyen levels which had required intubation at the outside\nhospital.
