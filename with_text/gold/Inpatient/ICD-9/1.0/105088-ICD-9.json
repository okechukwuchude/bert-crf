He\nwas discharged [**2146-3-9**] after a prolonged hospital course for\ngallstone pancreatitis. This was complicated by DVT,\nrespiratory/renal failure requiring mechanical ventillatory\nsupport and CVVHD, and pancreatic necrosis requiring\npercutaneous drainage. He improved and was discharged yesterday\nto a rehabilitation facility. Today, he returns with tachycardia\nand increased abdominal pain. The patient states that he began\nto experience abdominal pain yesterday afternoon while working\nwith PT. He states that this pain is similar to the epigastric\npain he has experienced all along only worse. He rated this as\nan [**9-6**] though currently [**7-7**]. He states that he was able to eat\ndinner (grilled chicken) without difficulty. He was eating\nbreakfast this morning and became nauseated while eating grapes.\nHe had several episodes of non-bilious emesis and was brought to\n[**Hospital1 18**] for further care given increased abdominal pain and\ntachycardia.\n\nPast Medical History:\nPMH: Gallstone pancreatitis as above, obesity, congenital\nblindness in right eye, left common iliac DVT .\n\nPSH: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy [**1-5**]\n\n\nSocial History:\nRecently married.

Minimal interval increase in size of right upper quadrant\npancreatic pseudocyst. Interval decrease in size of remaining\nloculated fluid collections.\n2. No pulmonary embolism present. Large bilateral pleural\neffusions with associated compression atelectasis.\n3. Increased amount of abdominal and pelvic free fluid.\n.\n[**2146-3-11**] BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS:\n1. Persistent non-occlusive thrombus in the left common femoral\nvein.\n2. No right lower extremity DVT.\n3. Small right popliteal cyst.\n.\n[**2146-3-15**] CXR:\nCardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged as well as there is no\nchange in extremely low lung volumes and bilateral pleural\neffusions, left more than right. There is mild prominence of the\nvasculature that appears to be more pronounced than on the prior\nstudy and might represent some degree of volume overload. The\nright internal jugular line tip appears to be atleast at the\ncavoatrial junction, but also may be present in the proximal\nright atrium.\n.\n[**2146-3-16**] ABD/PELVIC CT W/CONTRAST:\n1. Enlargement of the previously seen fluid collection and\nappearance of the numerous new large collections in the\nperitoneum. The drained collection has significantly decreased\nin size.\n2. Increase in pleural effusions: Left moderate and right\nminimal size, findings are accompanied by compressive\natelectasis.\n3. Minimal residual of the left common femoral vein and left\nexternal iliac vein thrombus.\n.\n[**2146-3-17**] AP CXR:\nIn comparison with the study of [**3-15**], there is still extremely\nlow lung volumes. Hazy opacification at the left base is\nconsistent with pleural fluid. Obscuration of the hemidiaphragm\nsuggests volume loss in the left lower lobe. The right lung is\nessentially clear and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular\ncongestion. The tip of the right IJ catheter is difficult to see\nbut appears to be in the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC.\n.\n1. Markedly decreased size of drained collection anterior to the\nstomach and surroiunding the left hepatic lobe. New extensive\nstranding and fluid within the gastrohepatic ligament and porta\nhepatis, possibly induced by leakage from one of the adjacent\ncollections or recurrent pancreatitis. Slight re-accumulation of\nfluid within the previously drained collection in the anterior\nabdomen, now measuring 14.3 x 1.6 x 5.4 cm. Otherwise, overall\ndecrease in multiple remaining peritoneal and extraperitoneal\nfluid collections compared to the prior study.\n2. Persistent bile duct dilation likely secondary to\npancreatitis. Increased attenuation of patent portal vein from\nadjacent new inflammation. Persistent marked attenuation of the\nsplenic vein. Smaller splenic infarcts.\n3. Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions and associated\ncompressive atelectasis.\n4. Unchanged thrombus within the left external iliac and common\niliac veins.\n.\n[**2146-3-28**] CXR:\nStable size of left pleural effusion with associated\nconsolidation which likely represents atelectasis but\nsuperimposed infection cannot be excluded.\n.\n[**2146-4-13**] ABD/PELVI CT W/CONTRAST:\n1. In this patient with known history of necrotizing\npancreatitis, there is enhancement of the distal body and tail\nof the pancreas with non visualization of the remainder of the\npancreas. Multiple extensive peripancreatic fluid collections\nhave decreased in size since the prior study.\n2. A small fluid collection adjacent to the inferior edge of\nright lobe of liver measuring 4.9 x 3.2 x 2.0 cm, is new since\nthe prior study.\n3. Unchanged left femoral vein thrombosis. Infrarenal IVC filter\nin place.\n4. Mild interval improvement in the small-to-moderate left\npleural effusion.  Compressive atelectasis of the left lower\nlobe is unchanged.\n.\n[**2146-4-15**] CXR:\nStatus after withdrawal of a left-sided chest tube. Minimal\napical and lateral basal pneumothorax without evidence of\ntension. Unchanged minimal atelectasis at the left lung base. No\nother changes. Normal cardiac silhouette.\n.\n[**2146-4-18**] CXR:\n1. Low lung volumes with left basilar subsegmental atelectasis,\nlikely related to the recent abdominal surgery and ongoing\nintra-abdominal process.\n2. No appreciable residual left pneumothorax.\n3. Left-sided PICC likely at the junction of that axillary and\nsubclavian vein; this may need to be advanced into a more\ncentral vein, depending on the indication for its use.\n.\n[**2146-4-20**] ABD/PELVIC CT W/O CONTRAST:\n1. Slightly decreased size of dominant central abdominal fluid\ncollection with left drain in satisfactory position. Right\ncatheter has been removed.\n2. Other fluid collections are little changed [**2146-4-13**].\n3. Resolving left pleural effusion with pleural air secondary to\nleft thoracic drain placement and removal. No new peripancreatic\nfluid collection.\n4. Hypodensity of the blood pool relative to the ventricular\nmyocardium is suggestive of anemia.\n5. Moderate biliary dilatation likely secondary to CBD\nobstruction by pseudocyst is similar to [**2146-4-13**].\n.\nMICROBIOLOGY:\nFLUID/WOUND CULTURES:\n[**2146-4-21**] 10:15 am FLUID,OTHER      LEFT FLANK ABSCESS.\n\n                            **FINAL REPORT [**2146-4-25**]**\n\n   GRAM STAIN (Final [**2146-4-21**]):\n      NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.\n      4+   (>10 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI.\n                                    IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS.\n      2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).\n\n   FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2146-4-25**]):\n      Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup\nis\n      performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep. are\nreported if\n      present.

Admission abdominal/pelvic CT revealed minimal\ninterval increase in size of right upper quadrant pancreatic\npseudocyst, but decrease in size of remaining loculated fluid\ncollections. Large bilateral pleural effusions with associated\ncompression atelectasis were noted, as well as increased amount\nof abdominal and pelvic free fluid. He was admitted to the SICU,\nmade NPO, started on vigorous IV fluid rescusitation, a foley\nwas placed, and he received IV pain medication with good effect.\nHe had a very long, and complicated hospital course.\n.\nIn the process of repairing his florid necrotizing pancreatitis\nsecondary to his history of severe gallstone pancreatitis, he\nultimately developed recurrent pseudocyts, which have plagued\nhim throughtout his hospital stays since [**48**]/[**2145**]. To date, these\npseudocyts have been managed largely with percutaneous catheter\ndrainage of the pseudocysts. Initially, during this admission,\nthis was the approach to managing the patient's recurring\npseudocyts. The patient underwent drainage of pancreatic\npseudocysts on [**2146-3-10**] and [**2146-3-18**], Ultrasound and CT-guided,\nrespectively. However, he developed an accumulating posterior\nretroperitoneal cyst, which continued to progress, and there was\nevidence of a disconnected pancreatic remnant within it. The\nrecent drainages of the other satellite lesions have dried them\nup. The main retroperitoneal cyst continued to grow in size, and\nbecame symptomatic for him. He was unable to eat full meals and\nhas a diminished capacity to keep food down, as well as a poor\nappetite. He also repeatedly spiked temperatures.\n.\nGiven his history of a left lower extremity acute deep venous\nthrombosis, Vascular Surgery was consulted. In lieu of planned\nsurgical intervention on [**2146-4-5**] for treatment of the above\npseudocyst with adhesions, the patient underwent placement of a\nBard G2 inferior vena cava filter, which went without\ncomplication. Then on [**2146-4-5**], the patient underwent external\ndrainage of pancreatic pseudocyst and extended adhesiolysis,\nwhich also went well without complication (see Operative Note).\nAfter a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient was\nreturned to the floor NPO with an NG tube, on IV fluids and TPN,\nwith a foley catheter and two JP drains in place (one in the\npseudocyst and one in the abdomen to drain ascites), he was\ncontinued on a Fentanyl patch and was given a Morphine PCA with\ngood effect. He was hemodynamically stable.\n.\nNEURO: Upon admission, the patient received IV pain medication\nPRN transitioned to a Morphine PCA with good effect and adequate\npain control. When tolerating oral intake, he was transitioned\nto oral pain medications. After the surgery on [**2146-4-5**], the\nChronic Pain Service was consulted. His pain was controlled once\nthe Fentanyl dose was increased to 75mcg/72Hr plus the Morphine\nPCA. When again tolerating a diet post-operatively, the PCA was\ndiscontinued, and he was started on oral pain medication in\naddition to the Fentanyl patch with continued good effect. He\nremained neurologically intact.\n.\nCV: Upon admission, tachycardia responded to vigorous IV fluid\nrescusitation and beta-blockade with Metoprolol 50mg TID.\nMetoprolol was increased to 75mg TID with eventual excellent\nrate and BP control. By discharge, the Metoprolol was decreased\nto 50mg [**Hospital1 **]. The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.\n.\nPULMONARY: Tachypnea on admission. Chest CTA revealed large\nbilateral pleural effusions with associated compression\natelectasis. Tachypnea resolved with diuresis with Lasix and\nsupplemental oxygen. He was given Albuterol and Atrovent\nnebulizer treatments, good pulmonary toilet and use of the\nincentive spirrometry were encouraged, and the patient received\nchest PT with improvement in overall respiratory status. Able to\nwean off supplemental oxygen. CXR on [**3-17**] revealed still\nextremely low lung volumes. Hazy opacification at the left base\nis consistent with pleural fluid. Obscuration of the\nhemidiaphragm suggests volume loss in the left lower lobe. The\nright lung was essentially clear and there was no evidence of\npulmonary vascular congestion.\n\nStarting on [**4-12**], he spiked a temperature to 103 PO and his WBC\nincreased from 13 to 23,000.  He had a CT abdomen performed\nwhich demonstrated a left pleural effusion\non the upper cuts of the abdomen. Thoracic surgery was consulted\nfor management of the pleural effusion. On [**2146-4-14**], he underwent\nultrasound-guided thorocentesis and placement of left pleural\npigtail catheter. Plural fluid for culture, gram stain,\ncytology, chemistries, and AFB was sent. The pleural pigtail\ncatheter was removed on [**4-15**]; post-removal CXR revealed minimal\napical and lateral basal pneumothorax without evidence of\ntension. Unchanged minimal atelectasis at the left lung base. A\nfollow-up CXR on [**2146-4-18**] showed continued low lung volumes with\nleft basilar subsegmental atelectasis, likely related to the\nrecent abdominal surgery and ongoing intra-abdominal process. No\nappreciable residual left pneumothorax was seen. The patient\nremained stable from a pulmonary standpoitn thereafter.\nRespiratory toilet, incentive spirrometry, and frequent\nambulation was encouraged.\n.\nGU/FEN: On admission, the patient was made NPO and he received\nvigorous IV fluid rescusitation. A foley catheter was placed.\nAllowed clears on [**3-11**] and [**3-12**], but an NG tube was placed on\n[**3-13**] for increased abdominal distension and emesis resulting\nwith 1400mL bilious output. After successful clamp trial\novernight, the NG tube was discontinued on [**3-15**] in the morning.\nGiven persistent problems with tolerating oral intake, a PICC\nwas placed, and TPN was started on [**2146-3-14**]. With the decision\nto proceed to surgery, TPN was continued through [**2146-4-12**]. When\nnot NPO for procedures, his diet was advanced back to low fat\nregular with good tolerability and intake. When the foley\ncatheter was removed after surgery, he was able to void without\nproblem. Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, and\nIV fluid was adjusted when necessary. Electrolytes were\nroutinely followed, and repleted when necessary.\n.\nGI: Admission liver and pancreatic enzymes were elevated.\nShortly after admission, the patient underwent ultrasound-guided\npseudocyst drainage measuring 1.7 liters of fluid with a\ndrainage catheter left in place to gravity on [**2146-3-10**]. Liver\nand pancreatic enzymes began trending down. Follow-up\nabdominal/pelvic CT on [**3-16**] demonstrated enlargement of the\npreviously seen fluid collection and appearance of the numerous\nnew large collections in the peritoneum. The drained collection\nhad significantly decreased in size. On [**3-18**], the patient\nreturned to Interventional Radiology for drainage of an anterior\ncollection, and placement of a new drainage catheter to gravity.\nThe previous drain was removed, and upper abdominal pseudocyst\nwas succesfully drained with a catheter left in place to\ngravity. Unfortunately, as noted above, he developed an\naccumulating posterior retroperitoneal cyst, which continued to\nprogress, and there was evidence of a disconnected pancreatic\nremnant within it. He underwent external drainage of pancreatic\npseudocyst and extended adhesiolysis as described above. A (L)\nflank drain was left in place. After the surgery, his symptoms\nimproved.\n.\nID: Admission blood cultures were negative. [**3-10**] fluid culture\nhad no growth. On [**3-17**] after receiving FFPs, the patient mounted\na fever with a Tmax 101.5 PO. Blood cultures were negative.\nFluid cutlure from the [**3-18**] drainage also revealed no growth.\nThe patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely\nwatched for signs of infection. Admission MRSA screen was\nnegative. After the [**2146-4-5**] surgery, cultures from the peritoneal\nfluid on [**4-14**], the (L) JP on [**4-19**], and the flank drain on [**4-21**]\nall grew out MRSA. The patient had been started on empiric IV\nVancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Flagyl when he spiked a\ntemperature on [**4-14**]. Fluconazole for empiric coverage after the\nthorocentesis was started on [**4-15**]. Flagyl, Cipro, and\nFluconazole were discontinued on [**4-16**]. Cipro restarted on [**4-21**].\nInfectious Disease was consulted for discharge antibiotic\nrecommendations; their input was greatly appreciated. Cipro was\ndiscomntinued, and oral Levofloxacin and Flagyl started on [**4-26**]\nwith Vancomycin continued. At discharge, the patient was sent\nhome on a two week course oral Linezolid, and a total of four\nweeks of oral Levofloxacin and Flagyl.\n.\nENDOCRINE: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout\nhis stay when he was on TPN; sliding scale insulin was\nadministered accordingly. He did not require exogenous insulin.\n.\nHEMATOLOGY: Upon admission, Coumadin was stopped, and the\npatient received 5 untis of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFPs) prior to\nfluid collection drainage in Intervention Radiology. On [**3-17**],\nFFPs were again administered in preparation for IR drainage of a\nlarge anterior abdominal fluid collection, but was stopped after\nthe patient experienced severe lower back pain after initiation\nof the second unit of FFP. On [**3-18**], he received a total of 4\nunits of FFPs prior to IR drainage of the aforementioned\ncollection. Prior to [**2146-4-5**] surgery, the patient received 2\nunits of PRBCs for a HCT of 22.2. He did not require any further\nblood products after this date. At discharge, his HCT was 23.7.\n.\nPROPHYLAXIS: History left common iliac DVT and HITs. Repeat\nduplex ultra-sound on admission confirmed persistent\nnon-occlusive thrombus in the left common femoral vein; no right\nDVT was seen. Chest CTA did not reveal a PE. On admission,\nCoumadin stopped, and Agatroban started. After the drainage of\nthe collection on [**3-10**], Agatroban was stopped, and Coumadin\nrestarted. Coumadin also restarted after reversal for second\ncollection drainage. After the surgery on [**2146-4-5**], the patient\nwas restarted on Argatroban. He was again converted back to\nCoumadin prior to discharge, at which time the INR was\ntherapeutic at 3.2 on a Coumadin dose of 2.5mg daily. INR goal\n2.5 with a therapeutic range of [**3-2**].\n.\nMOBILITY: The patient worked with Physical and Occupation\ntherapy extensively. By discharge, he was able to ambulate\nindependently. He was discharge home with PT and OT services.\n.\nAt the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile\nwith stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular\ndiet, ambulating with minimal assistance, voiding without\nassistance, and pain was well controlled.  He was discharged\nhome with VNA and PT services. The patient received discharge\nteaching and follow-up instructions with understanding\nverbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

It thins the blood\nto prevent clots from forming.\n\nWhat you should contact your healthcare provider [**Name Initial (PRE) **]:\n\nSigns of a life-threatening reaction. These include wheezing;\nchest tightness; fever; itching; bad cough; blue skin color;\nfits; or swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat, severe\ndizziness or passing out, falls or accidents, especially if you\nhit your head. Talk with healthcare provider even if you feel\nfine, significant change in thinking clearly and logically,\nsevere headache, severe back pain, severe belly pain, black,\ntarry, or bloody stools, blood in the urine, nosebleeds,\ncoughing up blood, vomiting blood, unusual bruising or bleeding,\n\nsevere menstrual bleedin, or rash.\n\nCall your doctor if you are unable to eat for several days, for\nwhatever reason. Also call if you have stomach problems,\nvomiting, or diarrhea that lasts more than 1 day. These problems\n\ncould affect your Coumadin??????/warfarin dosage.\n\nCoumadin (Warfarin) and diet:\n\nCertain foods and beverages can impair the effect of warfarin.\nFor this reason, it's important to pay attention to what you eat\n\nwhile taking this medication.\n\nUntil recently, doctors advised [**Name5 (PTitle) **] taking warfarin to avoid\nfoods high in vitamin K. This is because large amounts of\nvitamin K can counteract the benefits of warfarin. However,\nrecent research shows that rather than eliminating vitamin K\nfrom your diet, it is more important to be consistent in your\ndietary vitamin K intake.\n\nThese foods contain vitamin K:\n\nFruits and vegetables, such as: Kiwi, Blueberries, Broccoli,\nCabbage, [**Location (un) 2831**] sprouts, Green onions, Asparagus, Cauliflower,\n\nPeas, Lettuce, Spinach, Turnip, collard, and mustard greens,\nParsley, Kale, Endive. Meats, such as: Beef liver, Pork liver.\nOther: Mayonnaise, Margarine, Canola oil, Soybean oil, Vitamins,\n\nSoybeans and Cashews.\n\nLimit alcohol. Alcohol can affect your Coumadin??????/warfarin dosage\n\nbut it does not mean you must avoid all alcohol. Serious\nproblems can occur with alcohol and Coumadin??????/warfarin when you\ndrink more than 2 drinks a day or when you change your usual\npattern. Binge drinking is not good for you. Be careful on\nspecial occasions or holidays, and drink only what you usually\nwould on any regular day of the week.\n\nMonitoring:\n\nThe doctor decides how much Coumadin??????/warfarin you need by\ntesting your blood. The test measures how fast your blood is\nclotting and lets the doctor know if your dosage should change.\nIf your blood test is too high, you might be at risk for\nbleeding problems. If it is too low, you might be at risk for\nforming clots. Your doctor has decided on a range on the blood\ntest that is right for you. The blood test used for monitoring\nis called an INR.\n\nUse of Other medications:\n\nWhen Coumadin??????/warfarin is taken with other medicines it can\nchange the way other medicines work. Other medicines can also\nchange the way Coumadin??????/warfarin works. It is very important to\n\ntalk with your doctor about all of the other medicines that you\nare taking, including over-the-counter medicines, antibiotics,\nvitamins, or herbal products.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nProvider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6952**], MD (Hematology).\nPhone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 3241**] Date/Time:[**2146-5-18**] 2:00.
