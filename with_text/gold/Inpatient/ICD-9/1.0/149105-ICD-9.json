He reported that prior to walking his dog at\n5:10pm he was showering and developed SOB and dizzyness.\nSubsequently, while walking his dog he developed SOB, [**9-14**] SS\nchest pain and paramedics were called. On the ride to [**Hospital1 18**], his\npain started radiating to his left arm. A 12-lead ECG\ndemonstrated inferior ST elevations and ST depressions in the\nlateral and precordial leads.\n\nIn the ED, initial vital signs were the following: HR: 83 BP:\n118/75 Resp: 18 O(2)Sat: 100 Normal. He was given ASA 325 mg,\nPlavix 600 mg, heparin 5000 units IV, as well as 125 mg IV\nsolumedrol, and 50 mg IV famotidine (for contrast allergy) and\ntaken emergently to the cath lab where native coronary\nangiography demonstrated a 70% ostial LM lesion, a totally\noccluded mid LAD, a 95% thrombotic appearing mid LCX lesion, and\na totally occluded mid RCA. Graft angiography revealed a patent\nSVG to RCA/PDA, and a patent LIMA to LAD. The third vein graft\nwas not found despite non-selective power injection of the\naortic root, and was thought to likely be a SVG to OM that was\noccluded. Subsequent reports from [**Hospital1 2025**], revealed that he only had\na 2-vessel CABG (per cath report from [**2164**]). The LCX lesion was\nthought to the the culprit given its appearance, and this was\nopened with a BMS. After this lesion was opened the patient\nconverted into AIVR which lasted about 5 minutes. Given that LM\nhad a 70% ostial stenosis, it was decided that the patient would\nbenefit from increased coronary inflow, and a BMS was also\nplaced in the LM. After both interventions, the patient's chest\npain and prior ECG changes resolved. He was transferred to the\nCCU for close monitoring in good condition.\nOf note, the patient had significant confusion during the\ncardiac cath, asking repetitively where was and how he had\narrived in the cath lab. The patient noted a prior history of\nmental status changes with benadryl, and it was unclear if the\npatient??????s mental status changes in the cath lab were the result\nof the fentanyl and versed that he received.\n\n\nOn review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,\nTIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the\ntime of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black\nstools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or\nrigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the\nother review of systems were negative.\n\nCardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,\ndyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,\nankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.\n\nPast Medical History:\n1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Dyslipidemia\n2. CARDIAC HISTORY:\n- CABG: LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA\n3.

Consider acute inferior\nmyocardial infarction.\n\nCATH [**2168-2-13**]:\n1. Selective native coronary angiography in this right dominant\nsystem\ndemonstrated severe 3 vessel and left main coronary artery\ndisease.  The\nLMCA had a 70% ostial lesion.  The LAD was totally occluded in\nits mid\nsegment.  The LCx had a 95% thrombotic appearing lesion in its\nmid\nsegment.  The RCA was totally occluded in its mid segment.\n2. Selective venous conduit angiography demonstrated a patent\nSVG to\ndistal RCA graft.\n3. Non-selective arterial conduit angiography demonstrated a\npatent LIMA\nto LAD with a kink in its midcourse.\n4. Supravalvular aortography did not demonstrate any additional\ngrafts.\n5. Primary PCI was delayed due to difficulty in locating the\npatient's\nprior bypass grafts and therefore determining the culprit artery\n(no\nreports of the anatomy were available and the patient stated\nthat he had\n3 grafts despite our ability to only locate 2), and because\npatient\nagitation due to a paradoxical reaction to fentanyl caused a\ndelay in\nthe ability to safely carry out the procedure.\n6. Successful direct stenting of the Cx with a 3.0x12mm\nINTEGRITY\nstent. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no\nangiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (see PTCA\n\ncomments).\n7. Successful direct stenting of the LMCA with a 4.5x18mm ULTRA\nstent.\nFinal angiography revelaed no residual stneosis, no\nangiographically\naparent dissection and TIMI III flow (see PTCA comments).\n8. Patient went into AIVR post stenting of the Cx lesion. Rhythm\nlasted\nfive minutes, and patient remained hemodynamically stable\nthroughout.\n9. Successful closure of the 6 French right femoral arteriotomy\nsite\nwith a 6 French Angioseal VIP device with good resultant\nhemostasis.\n11. Limited resiting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic\narterial\nblood\npressure with a central aortic blood pressure of 126/77.\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:\n1. Three vessel native coronary artery disease with a 95%\nthrombotic LCx\nlesion thought to the cause of the patient's acute STEMI.\n2. Patent LIMA to LAD.\n3. Patent SVG to RCA.\n4. No other grafts demonstrated on aortography.\n2. Successful direct stenting of the Cx with a BMS.\n3. Successful direct stenting of the LMCA with a BMS.\n4. Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site with\nan\nAngioseal VIP device.\n8. Normal central aortic blood pressure.\n\nECHO [**2168-2-15**]:\nThe left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left\nventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and\nregional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of\naorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good\nleaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic\nregurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with\ntrivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic\npressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial\neffusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with\npreserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.\nNo pathologic valvular abnormality seen.\n\nSUBMAXIMAL STRESS [**2168-2-17**]:\nNo anginal symptoms with nonspecific ST segment changes.\nAttaining a submaximal level of 7 METs indicates an average\nexercise\ntolerance for his age, however patient could have attained\nhigher level\nof work. Appropriate hemodynamic response to exercise. Echo\nreport sent\nseparately.\n\nSTRESS ECHO [**2168-2-17**]:\n\nThe patient exercised for 9 minutes and 0 seconds according to a\nModified [**Doctor First Name **] treadmill protocol (7 METS) reaching a peak heart\nrate of 125 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 134/40 mmHg. The\ntest was stopped because of fatigue. This level of exercise\nrepresents an average exercise tolerance for age (submaximal\ntest obtained as the patient is s/p STEMI). In response to\nstress, the ECG showed no diagnostic ST-T wave changes (see\nexercise report for details). There were normal blood pressure\nand heart rate responses to stress.\n\nResting images were acquired at a heart rate of 69 bpm and a\nblood pressure of 104/59 mmHg. These demonstrated normal\nregional and global left ventricular systolic function. Doppler\ndemonstrated no aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation or\nsignificant mitral regurgitation or resting LVOT gradient.\nEcho images were acquired within 45 seconds after peak stress at\nheart rates of 120-97 bpm. These demonstrated appropriate\naugmentation of all left ventricular segments.\n\nIMPRESSION: Average functional exercise capacity (submaximal\nworkload as patient is s/p STEMI). No diagnostic ECG changes in\nthe absence of 2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible\nischemia to achieved workload.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nHOSPITAL COURSE: 63 year old man with a history of CAD s/p CABG\nwho presented to the ED with chest pain while walking his dog\nand was found to have an inferior STEMI. Received BMS\nimplantation to native LCX and LM.\n\n# Inferior STEMI: The patient presented with STE of II,III, and\navF and STD depression in V2-V5. In the cath lab, his native\ncoronary angiography demonstrated a 70% ostial LM lesion, a\ntotally occluded mid LAD, a 95% thrombotic appearing mid LCX\nlesion, LM had a 70% ostial stenosis and a totally occluded mid\nRCA. Graft angiography revealed a patent SVG to RCA/PDA, and a\npatent LIMA to LAD. A BMS was placed to the LCX and LM. He had\nseveral episodes of [**2165-12-8**] resting CP in the two days after the\nintervention that were relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin. A\nsubmaximal stress echo was performed which demonstrated no\nevidence of ischemia by ECG or echocardiogram. Pt was discharged\non ASA, plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, sl ntg, imdur and\nrosuvastatin. Creatinine was stable despite contrast load.\n\n# Hyperlipidemia: on rosuvastatin at home, switched to high dose\natorvastatin hwile an inpatient given STEMI. Changed to\nrosuvastatin 40 at discharge.\n\n# Hyperglycemia: BS moderately elevated on routine labs. Pt\nstates his blood sugar has been elevated at times but A1C has\nbeen nl. A1c was normal on recheck.\n\n# Temporal lobe epliepsy- per patient develops flushing,. We\ncontinued depakote 250mg 5 times daily (qAM, qNoon, qPM, and 2\ntabs qHS). He remained well controlled.\n\n# ADHD: we continued venlafaxine and held strattera due to risk\nof adverse cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nTRANSITONAL ISSUES: Followup with PCP and cardiologist was\narranged.

The catheterization showed that your grafts\nfrom the operation were open and had good blood flow but there\nwas a clot in your left circumflex artery that was causing the\nheart attack. You received a bare metal stent but also needed a\nbare metal stent in your left main artery to increase blood flow\nto the area. You will need to take plavix for at least one year\nand possibly longer to prevent the stent from clotting off. Do\nnot stop taking Plavix or aspirin or miss [**First Name (Titles) 691**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4319**] unless Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) 96196**] says it is OK. This is extremely important to prevent\nanother heart attack. An echocardiogram was done that showed\nthat your heart function is normal. You had some chest pain\nafter the cathererization which was treated with nitroglycerin\nbut this did seem to cause any damage to your heart. Your stress\ntest was negative. You will have nitroglycerin tablets to take\nat home. Please take this for any chest pain that is similar to\nthe pain of your heart attack. You can take one pill, wait 5\nminutes, then take another pill if you still have chest pain.\nCall 911 if you still have chest pain after 2 [**Last Name (STitle) 4319**] of\nnitroglycerin. Call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 96196**] if you use any nitroglycerin at\nall. You can also call the heartline to talk to a cardiologist\nor NP here who can help you with your symptoms.\nYou received a lot of contrast during your catheterization. This\ncan sometimes affect your kidney function. So far, you have not\nhad any changes in your kidney function but please get blood\ndrawn on Thursday to check again.\n.\nWe made the following changes to your medicines:\n1. Continue aspirin forever, talk to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 96196**] before you stop\nthe aspirin for any reason.\n2. Increase the Crestor to 40 mg to lower your cholesterol\n3. Start taking metoprolol to lower your heart rate and help\nyour heart recover from the heart attack\n4. Start taking lisinopril to lower your blood pressure and help\nyour heart recover from the heart attack.\n5. Start taking Clopidogrel (Plavix) to keep the stents from\nclotting off and causing another heart attack. Do not stop this\nmedicine unless you talk to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 96196**] first.\n6.
