She went for a diagnostic angiogram,\nhowever, due to her pain and agitation, the procedure was unable\nto be completed. She returned to the ICU. Her post op check was\nnegative.  She continued to have a very severe HA, but her exam\nwas non focal.\n\nOn [**7-31**], the patient underwent another angio, but this time had a\ngeneral anesthesia in order to complete the procedure. This\nrevealed a right AICA aneurysm that was successfully coiled.\n\nPost angiogram patient was transferred to the ICU for\nobservation and monitoring for Vasospasm. She was maintained on\nIV fluids with a goal to keep her euvolemic. Her severe\nheadaches were treated with a steroid taper and narcotic pain\nmeds which seemed to be effective.\n\nThroughout her ICU course her exam remained non-focal.\n\nOn [**8-6**] she was cleared for transfer to the floor. Her IV fluids\nwere decreased to 50ml/hr. Current pain regimen appears to\nalleviate the headaches, at least to a tolerable level. PT\nconsult was requested.\n\non [**8-7**] we discontinued her IV fluids and changed her pain\nmedications to dilaudid P.O prn and obtained a CTA to evaluate\nthe amount of bld and underlying vasospasm. This was significant\nfor mild to moderate vasospasm therefore her IV fluids were\nrestarted on [**8-8**].\n\nOn [**8-9**] and [**8-10**] she remained neurologically stable but had\npersistant headaches. She was started on Topamax in addition to\nher existing pain regimen to attempt to help with this. She also\ndescribed some chest discomfort that she had x1 therefore an EKG\nwas obtained which was negative for changes, NSR. blood cultures\nthat were obtained on [**8-8**] for fever work up revealed VIRIDANS\nSTREPTOCOCCI from sample that was obtained from PICC line\ntherefore the PICC was discontinued. Repeat blood cultures were\nordered.\n\n[**8-11**]: CTA showed no vasospasm and pt was cleared for discharge\nfrom neurosurgical standpoint. She was cleared for home without\nservices from PT/OT. She will be discharged home in stable\ncondition on [**8-12**] with plan to follow up in clinic in 4 weeks.\nShe will also have a repeat cerebral angiogram in 4 weeks as\nwell.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nLipitor 20mg QD, Percocet/Valium\nprn\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
