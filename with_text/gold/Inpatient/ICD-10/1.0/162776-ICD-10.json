Her hypernatremia was due to poor access\nto free water in this demented elderly woman with impaired\nthirst and LASIX TREATMENT. She had no evidence of central or\nnephrogenic DI. Her free water deficit at admission was 7.6-9.2L\n(depending on whether her water is 50-60% of her body weight).\nShe was corrected with D5W and [**2-6**] normal saline for\nconservative management. On [**2-2**], she was switched back to D5W\nbecause of slowed correction. A picc line was placed for better\naccess and ease of blood draws given need for close monitoring\nof electrolytes. Her sodium on discharge was 147. She will\nreceive additional IV fluids for 24 hours and then oral\nhydration of 1500 ML/ Hour. Her delirium/altered mental status\nwas from her hypernatremia, dehydration, UTI, ARF, and abnormal\nmental status at baseline. Per daughter, the patient has\nnonsensical speech at baseline.  Her mental status improved back\nto baseline over the course of her hospitalization. The\npatient's creatinine was increased to 2.4 at admission (baseline\nCr 1.3-1.7. Her renal function improved to baseline with IV\nfluid rehydration given for hypernatremia correction. Lisinopril\nwas initially held and then restarted on [**2-2**] when renal\nfunction at baseline. She received Ceftriaxone for 5 days for\nUTI and urine culture grew proteus mirabilis and MORGANELLA\nMORGANII. She will receive Bactrim and Augmentin for additional\n3 days. Her Foley was discontinued on discharge. She had\nhypertensive urgency but no emergency. Lasix was stopped and\nshould NOT be resumed. She received Lisinopril and Norvasc for\nHTN treatment. She may remain hypertensive at NH but no evidence\nfrom radpi reduction of BP woith IV medications unless emergency\n(end organ damage). She was initially NPO except for medications\ngiven poor mental status. She had a speech and swallow\nevaluation that showed aspiration of thin liquids. She had a\nrepeat speech and swallow eval when sodium normalized and she\nwas able to have thickened liquids.\n\n# Code:  DNR/DNI BUT SHOULD BE HOSPICE AT SOME POINT\n\n.\n# Comm:  Daughter [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1785**] [**Known lastname **] (cell) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 111486**]; (home)\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 111487**].

Other possibilities include central or nephrogenic DI, though\n   these are considerably less likely.  Her free water deficit is 7.6-9.2L\n   (depending on whether her water is 50-60% of her body weight).  This\n   should be given over a 3 day period to correct her at 0.5mEq/hour.\n   Thus, D5W at just over 100cc/hr should correct her at the appropriate\n   rate.  Per renal recs, we will start with 1/2 NS and monitor serial\n   sodiums so as not to correct her too quickly\n   - 1/2 NS at 100cc/hr, adjust prn\n   - monitor Q4H serum sodium for now\n   - appreciate input from renal\n   - check Posm, Uosm, UNa\n   # Altered mental status:\n   Most probably from her hypernatremia and dehydration superimposed on\n   abnormal mental status at baseline.\n   - contact [**Name (NI) 122**] for further information as to her baseline\n   - treat hypernatremia and likely UTI\n   - avoid sedating meds\n   - monitor for delirium\n   # Acute renal failure:  baseline Cr 1.3-1.7, current Cr 2.4\n   Suspect that patient is dehydrated, and lasix and lisinopril may have\n   contributed to the toxicity of her prerenal state.  She received 1L of\n   NS in the ED.\n   - recheck Cr in AM\n   - send urine lytes\n   - hold lisinopril\n   # Possible UTI:\n   - continue ceftriaxone started in the ED (day 1 = [**1-30**])\n   - f/u urine culture\n   - patient's foley was placed in ED; will leave in for now given\n   hypernatremia\n   # Macrocytosis:  check folate and B12\n   # Abnormal CXR:\n   Noted to possibly have widened mediastinum and possible hiatal hernia\n   on recent CXR.\n   - recheck PA/lat CXR in AM\n   # HTN:\n   - hold lisinopril and lasix for now given ARF\n   - continue ASA\n   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue statin\n   # FEN:  NPO except meds for now until mental status better; IVF as\n   above\n   # PPx:  subQ heparin [**Hospital1 **] given size and age; famotidine while NPO\n   # Access:  PIV\n   # Code:  DNR/DNI (paperwork in chart)\n   # Comm:  Daughter [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 919**] [**Known lastname **] (cell) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10080**]; (home)\n   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10081**].
