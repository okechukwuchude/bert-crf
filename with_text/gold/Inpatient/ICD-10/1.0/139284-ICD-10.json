Went to local ER.  Gave amp D50 and gave her\nzosyn, but there is no documented temperature.  She was noted to\ndesat to the 70s on RA, but she was asymptomatic.  She was put\non nonrebreather. She was also noted to be bradycardic in 40s.\nShe was tx here for further management.  Upon arrival, she was\nagain without complaints.  She was noted to desat to 82 without\nNRB.\n\nVitals in the ED: HR 60s.  T 92-93 rectal.  HR 60, BP 160/63, RR\n19, 98%NRB.  No other antibiotics.  1 blood and urine here.  2\nbloods at outside ed.  lactate 1.5.  Cr 1.4 there, 1.8 here.  No\nCTA done, but she was placed on heparin out of concern for PE.\nShe was put on a warming blanket.\n\nIn the ICU, she endorsed cough x 2 days, atypical chest pain.\nShe denies abd pain, dysuria or increased frequency, diarrhea,\nn/v.  She subsequently developed hypotension with SBP 70s to\n80s.  Given her evolving sepsis picture, pulmonary edema,\npossible benefit of better monitoring, and possible need for\npressors, an arterial line was placed and she was intubated.\n\nPast Medical History:\n#. Chronic Systolic CHF EF 20%:\n- h/o hospitalizations for CHF exacerbation\n- Echo [**10-17**]: Moderate symmetric LVH with severe global left\nventricular dysfunction (EF 20-25%) Moderate tricuspid\nregurgitation.

Seizure disorder\n\n\nSocial History:\nThe patient was previously living in [**Location (un) **] with her other\ndaughter. She recently returned to [**Location 86**] to live with her\ndaughter [**Name (NI) 70555**] who is employed at [**Hospital1 18**] as a coworker\n[**Name (NI) 1139**]: Quit 1 year ago, previously [**12-13**] PPD x 50 years\nETOH: Rare\nIllicits: None\n\n\nFamily History:\nMother with DM, breast cancer, MI in her 70's.

Again, this is\nconsistent with\nARDS, though vascular congestion or diffuse pneumonia can\ncertainly not be\nexcluded radiographically. Various monitoring and support\ndevices remain in place. The left hemidiaphragm is not sharply\nseen on the current study. This could reflect some pleural\nfluid, atelectatic change, or even focal\nconsolidation at the left base.\n\nABD/PELVIS CT [**10-18**]:\n1. Significantly limited CT examination without intravenous\ncontrast with no source of infection identified. If there\nremains a high clinical concern for an occult infection, can\nconsider correlation with a dedicated tagged white cell scan.\n2. Ground glass and interstitial opacities within visualized\nlung bases in\nconjunction with small bilateral pleural effusions, small\npericardial\neffusion, and probable compression atelectasis. These all likely\nrelate to\nfluid overload/CHF with no discrete pneumonia noted.\n3. Diffuse anasarca.\n4. Unchanged pancreatic parenchymal calcifications again\nsuggestive of prior episodes of pancreatitis.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n62 yo female with DM, HTN, CAD, dementia, who presented with\nhypothermia, hypoxia, and hypotension.\n\n# Sepsis: The patient's clinical picture was consistent with\nsepsis, initially concerning for urosepsis based on her UA in\nthe ED. Early goal-directed therapy was initiated, with prompt\ntransfer to the ICU.  However, no bacteria grew from the urine,\nand nothing was grown from blood and sputum cultures. She was\ncovered broadly with vancomycin, zosyn, and levofloxacin and she\nimproved clinically.  She was ruled out for respiratory viruses.\n Podiatry was consulted and did not feel that her left foot was\ninfected, only colonized.  Bronchoscopy was also not revealing.\nCT abd & pelvis were also unremarkable for source. Given no\nclear source and clinical improvement she was given a 10-day\ncourse of empiric antibiotics with the last doses on [**10-25**]. She\nremained afebrile during the latter portion of her hospital\ncourse.\n\n# Hypotension/Hypertension: The patient was hypotensive on\nadmission requiring agressive fluid resuscitation (11L in the\nfirst 24 hours) and pressors.  She became hypertensive after the\nsecond or third day of her ICU stay and was gradually started\nback on some of her home medications, metoprolol and amlodipine.\n Hydralazine was started due to hypertension and wanting to hold\nenalapril and HCTZ given her acute renal failure.  As kidney\nfunction improved enalapril was started and gradually titrated\nupward, while Hydralazine was discontinued. Her\nanti-hypertensive regimen will need further adjustment as an\noutpatient.\n\n# Respiratory Failure: While in the ICU, she developed\nprogressive respiratory distress requiring endotracheal\nintubation, the etiology of which proved unclear. Serial CXRs\nappeared most consistent with ARDS, but lung compliance proved\ngood on the ventilator.  Fluid overload was also postulated. She\nwas diuresed with Lasix, and successfully extubated on [**2120-10-23**].\n Her length of stay fluid balance was still +4 L at the time of\ndischarge but she was autodiuresing well so no diuretics were\ninitiated.\n\n# Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine was elevated to 1.8 on\nadmission and peaked at 2.1 but returned to a baseline of 1.2.\nThe patient likely had ARF [**1-13**] hypoperfusion.\n\n# Question of DIC: Concering because of thrombocytopenia and\ncoagulopathy.  However, Heme was consulted and did not think her\npresentation was consistent with DIC.  She also ruled out for\nHIT.  Her platelet count was stable at the time of discharge.\n\n# Chronic diastolic heart failure: Pt. was found to have a\nnormal EF on ECHO (>55%) and severe diastolic dysfunction.  She\nwas restarted on an ACEi as described above, a beta blocker, and\naspirin.\n\n# History of seizure: Patient has a history of a recent seizure\nof unclear etiology.  It may be related to a past stroke,\nhowever.  She was managed with keppra.\n\n# DM: Patient was managed on an ISS while inpatient.  At the\ntime of discharge, her daughter reported episodes of\nhypoglycemia as an outpatient and requested a script for\nglucagon pens, which were given.\n\n# Foot ulcers/bullae: Podiatry evaluated the patient's foot\nulcers and made recommendations for wound care.  Her ulcers grew\npan-resistant bacteria (including VRE) but they felt that the\nulcers were not the cause of her septic presentation, and that\nthey were instead colonized.  She additionally improved\nclinically in the abscence of directed antimicrobial therapy\nagainst VRE. She was discharged with wound care recommendations\nfor at-home wound care.\n\n# CAD/hx of stroke: Patient was discharged on ASA and a beta\nblocker.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nPer D/C summary [**10-8**]:\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
