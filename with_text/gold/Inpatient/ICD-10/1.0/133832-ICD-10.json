Pt was in his usual state\nof health until 2.5 weeks ago, he began to note diffuse\nabdominal pain.  This was accompanied by increasing\nconstipation, self-medicated with increasing doses of lactulose\nto 30 cc every 3-4 hours.  Due to increasing pain and\nconstipation, his PO intake has been minimal and he has\ndiscontinued all of his PO medications.  Abdominal pain was\naccompanied by nausea, and vomitting of muddy material.  Also\nduring this same time course, he has noted black stools.  At\napproximately 2 AM, he began to have frankly bloody stools with\nclots and thus came into the hospital.  His last ETOH\nconsumption was at approximately 7 PM yesterday.  Of note, he\nhas been taking ibuprofen 1200 mg [**Hospital1 **] for the last few weeks\nafter running out of his percocet.  He has been on percocet for\nchronic knee pain.  Per pt, last EGD a few years ago at [**Hospital1 2025**] that\nwas unremarkable per his knowledge.\n.\nReview of systems is positive for increasing abdominal girth in\nthe last 4 days.

He passed multiple frankly bloody stools, NG\nlavage with coffee ground emesis, not clearing with 500cc NS.\nGiven 5 L IVF with recovery of SBP to 110s.  Given protonix 80\nIV, started on protonix gtt, octreotide, dilaudid 0.5 IV, pIV 18\nand 16g.  Labs pending at time of transfer, typed and crossed\nfor 4 units.  Per GI, plan to scope ASAP in MICU.

Known cirrhosis s/p TIPS,\nultrasound on admission showed patent TIPS but with decreased\nvelocity.  He was transfused two units of PRBC's on admission,\nstarted on both octreotide and PPI drips.  In addition to\ncirrhosis, the patient also had active alcohol use and high dose\nNSAID use.  He was seen by the liver service and underwent an\nurgent upper endoscopy that showed duodenal ulcers with no\nactive bleeding, grade I esophageal varices with no stigmata of\nrecent bleeding, and one ulcer with clot indicating likely\nsource of recent GIB. Pt received 3 units PRBC in MICU total,\nhct stable and increased appropriately with transfusion\npost-EGD. Melena thought to be [**1-13**] resolving UGIB from ulcers\nrather than new lower GIB. He was transitioned to po PPI with a\nstable hct, continued on Ceftriaxone which was transitioned to\nCipro, and discharged with outpatient followup.\n.\n# Cirrhosis - Cirrhosis felt to be secondary to ETOH abuse.\nCurrently with acute elevation of liver enzymes, with AST/ALT\nratio > 2 and elevated bilirubin. Acute decompensation maybe\nrelated to TIPS stenosis, ETOH hepatitis, infection. Also with\nmild synthetic dysfunction. RUQ US for TIPS patency showed\nslowed velocity, and patient will need IR TIPS venogram once\nstable as an outpatient. US showed insufficient ascites for\nparacentesis, unlikely to be SBP.\n.\n# Alcohol abuse - Tremulous, last drink the afternoon prior to\nadmission.  He was initially managed on a Q1h CIWA scale, but\nwas quickly able to be tapered to a Q4h CIWA scale, he was\ninitially given a banana bag, then maintained on folic acid, MVI\nand thiamine daily.  He was stable at the time of discharge\nwithout need for Valium.\n.\n# Acute renal failure - Likely pre-renal in setting of GIB and\npoor PO intake, FeUrea was 4.8%, consistent with a prerenal\netiology and his creatinine improved with blood transfusions and\nIV fluids.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nCurrent Medications:  As noted above, he has discontinued his\nmedications as of several weeks ago.
