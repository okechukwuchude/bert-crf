She\ninitially presented with fever to 101 after HD on [**1-10**] treated\nwith 650mg of Tylenol at rehab, rechecked at 101.3, and noted\nhave some chills by the nurse. She was subsquently sent to the\nED.\n.\nThe patient reports feeling well overall the days prior to\nadmission. She denies any N/V, cough, shortness of breath, sore\nthroat, rhinnorhea, or abdominal pain. She reports a good\nappetite. She does complain that the rehab was not dosing her\nantibiotics appropriately and was only giving her Linezolid once\ndaily until she corrected them a few days ago.\n.\nOf note, the patient was recently admitted on [**3-11**] for VRE\nBacteremia and was treated with Linezolid for a planned 4 week\ncourse; she subsequently had her HD lined removed, underwent a\nline holiday and then a new line was placed. Also of note, she\nhas been on Dapsone for PCP prophylaxis as well as Gancyclovir\nfor CMV viremia.\n.\nOn arrival to the ED, her vitals were: T 99.8 BP 93/60 HR 120\nRR22 98%RA. Labs were done which showed WBC 4 with 8% bandemia,\nLactate 4.8. CXR was negative, U/A not done as pt is anuric.\nBlood cultures were drawn. EKG showed sinus tachycardia with\nflattening laterally. She was given 2L IVF and Vanc/Imipenem for\nempiric coverage of an unclear source given her history. A CVL\nwas offered but the patient refused so an EJ was placed.\n.\nIn the MICU, the patient was started on daptomycin, imipenem\nswitched to meropenem and vanc continued.

In addition, her WBC was 4.0\nbut with an 8% bandemia. She has had a number of infections\nrecently in the setting of immunosuppression. The differential\nwas broad including line infection (new HD line placed on [**12-31**]),\npneumonia (CXR without obvious infiltrate), CMV Viremia (viral\nload [**12-29**] negative), UTI, C. Diff (recent infection [**11-5**] but\nwithout any symptoms to suggest this). Patients BP/HR improved\nafter administration of 2L IVF, and broad coverage with\nMeropenem (GN coverage) plus Daptomycin (GP coverage) as well as\nPO Vanc, given bandemia. BCx, C.Diff cx, and CMV viral load were\nalso obtained and were negative.  However, after speaking with\nID valganciclovir was restarted. During hospitalization,\nantibiotics were narrowed to daptomycin. Patient will need to\ncomplete 4 week course of Daptomycin for VRE bacteremia in\nsetting of known thrombus that is possibly seeded.  She will\nreceive Daptomycin when she receives HD.  The renal team has\narranged for her to get the medication at HD. The last dose will\nbe on [**2150-1-26**].\n.\n# T Wave Inversions: Patient's T waves were upright at the time\nof admission.  She then developed inverted T waves in V3-V6, I,\nII, aVF, and intermittently/biphasic in V2 (see attached EKGs\ncopied from [**Hospital1 18**]), with repeated negative cardiac enzymes. Then\nshe developed more deeply inverted T waves in V2 that were deep\nand symmetrical during HD on [**1-17**] that then turned upright. It\nwas not clear that the T wave inversions were rate related.\nCardiology was [**Month/Year (2) 4221**]. The ddx included: ischemia,\nTakotsubo's, or a cerebral processes, however rapid resolution\nof the T waves made the later two less likely. She denied chest\ndiscomfort though she occasionally had nausea. She did not have\nany neurological symptoms. Patient has no LVH on prior ECHOs to\ninvoke repolarization changes.  Recommend performing persantine\nstudy to r/o ischemia as an outpatient, not initiated as an\ninpatient given difficulty to instigate intervention in this\nsetting with recent bacteremia and RUE thrombus.  In the mean\ntime, patient is medically managed for coronary artery disease;\nshe is on aspirin and small dose of beta-blocker.  Simvastatin\nwas added during this admission.\n.\n# Tachycardia: In addition to atrial fibrillation which is\ncurrently controlled, she had multiple episodes of regular\ntachycardia.  EKG revealed sinus tach.  In terms of the\netiologies of sinus tachycardia, she had evidence of volume\ndepletion, especially after HD, which likely led to low systolic\nblood pressures in the 90s and sinus tachycardia.  Sinus\ntachycardia invariably improved/resolved after gentle IVF\n(250cc-500cc NS).  She also experienced nausea during some\nepisodes of tachycardia, raising the question whether the\ntachycardia is due to discomfort. However, after treatment with\nzofran and resolution of nausea, her heart rate remained in the\n120s, which argues against that theory.\n.\n# Low Blood Pressure: Patient's baseline systolic blood pressure\nis 100s to 110s, though was noted to occasionally be in the 90s,\nwhich responded to small IVF boluses (250-300cc). It was thought\nto be secondary to volume shifts and possibly be exacerbated by\nautonomic instability.  She should continue on Midodrine 10mg\nTID.\n.\n# ESRD on HD s/p failed transplant: Patient was continued on HD\nand maintained on Prednisone.\n.\n# Venous thrombus: Patient was noted to have a complete\nthrombosis of the left AV [**Month/Year (2) **], left cephalic vein and left\nsubclavian  vein, and partial thrombosis of left brachiocephalic\nvein with extension to SVC on her previous admission. She was\nunable to receive a PICC on that side [**12-30**] this thrombus (and not\non the right [**12-30**] presence of fistula).  She was maintained on\nwarfarin with goal [**12-31**] and should continue anticoagulation until\nresolution of the thrombus or indefinitely.\n.\n# CMV viremia: Patient has been treated with valganciclovir.\nThis was briefly stopped out of concern for myelosuppression but\nsubsequently restarted per ID. Plan is for her to f/u with\noutpatient ID with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2150-1-21**] regarding need to\ncontinue this treatment.\n.\n# Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  On [**1-13**] patient was transferred\nto MICU for afib with RVR and hypotension. She was treated with\ndigoxin load and PRN PO metoprolol. She will continue on digoxin\n0.125mg 3/week and metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] as an outpatient, with\nholding parameters for SBP<95 or HR<55.\n.\n# Nausea: Patient had repeated bouts of nausea accompanied by\ntachycardia in the 120-140 and hypotension that resolved with\nondansetron. This appears to occur after HD and may be related\nto volume depletion.  She also often gets nausea after eating.\nPatient repeatedly denied SOB or chest discomfort. Repeated\ncardiac enzymes were negative.\n.\n# Anticoagulation: Patient should continue on coumadin with goal\nINR [**12-31**].\n.\n# Code status: Full Code\n\nMedications on Admission:\nAspirin 325 mg daily\nPantoprazole 40 mg daily\nPrednisone 5 mg Tablet daily\nValganciclovir 450 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO 2X/WEEK\n(TU,TH).\nMidodrine 10mg TID\nLinezolid 600 mg [**Hospital1 **] until [**1-19**]\nOxycodone 5 mg q6 prn\nInjection q dialysis.\nHumalog 100 unit/mL Cartridge Sig: sliding scale\nSubcutaneous QACHS.\nWarfarin 2.5 mg daily\nDapsone 100 mg daily\nZofran 4 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as\nneeded for nausea.\nAtovaquone 1500 daily\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
