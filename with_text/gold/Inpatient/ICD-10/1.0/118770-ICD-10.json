Large pleural effusions bilaterally.\n4. Echogenic appearance of the kidneys, suggestive of possible\nparenchymal\nrenal disease.\n\nPortable CXR [**2139-12-30**]:\nThe ET tube tip is 3.7 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is\nin the\nstomach. The right internal jugular line is at the proximal\nright atrium.\nThe pigtail catheter inserted in the right basal hemithorax is\nunchanged in position. There is no interval change in the\nwidespread consolidations mostly involving left lung but also\nseen in the right lung base. The surgical clips projecting over\nthe abdomen are unchanged.\n\nMicrobiology:\nNo growth on several blood, urine, stool, lavaged samples.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n41 year old man with a history significant for rhabdomyosarcoma\ntesticular cancer as a child s/p resection, chemotherapy and\nradiation who presented with back pain, admitted to the ICU for\nseptic shock.\n.\n# Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Based on initial CXR, etiology\nseemed most consistent with multifocal PNA and ARDS.  Initially\nPE was considered and the patient was started on heparin drip\nbriefly, however determined to be unlikely based on septic\nphysiology.  Unlikely cardiogenic pulmonary edema as initial\nmixed venous sat was in the 80s.  However, a repeat mixed venous\nsat the following day was 46.  A TTE was done at the bedside to\nevaluate for cardiogenic cause of respiratory failure, and found\nto have a globally decreased EF, consistent with septic\nphysiology.  The patient had worsening tachypnea and hypoxia on\nthe floor, was transferred to the ICU the night of admission and\nwas intubated within hours.  The patient was treated with ARDS\nnet protocol, with increased PEEP and decreased tidal volumes.\nThe patient was unable to be weaned from the ventilator despite\nbeing treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for bilateral\npneumonia and volume removal with CVVH after aggressive volume\nresuscitation.  Patient underwent bronchoscopy and BAL which\nwere unrevealing to cause.  As the patient became more difficult\nto ventilate and CXRs showed progression of bilateral\ninfiltrates despite volume removal and antibiotics, a contrast\nCT scan was done which showed large bilateral pleural effusions,\nworse on the right than left, ground glass infiltrates and\nairbronchograms especially on the left.  The descision was made\nto do a diagnostic thoracentesis.  Dark yellow, thick fluid with\n[**Last Name (un) 15936**] was expressed from the pleura on the right side.  A chest\ntube was placed for continuous drainage.  The fluid was found to\nbe exudative with a large number of WBC however no organisms\ngrew from this fluid, however it was thought to be a complicated\nparapneumonic fluid.  The patient was unable to be weaned from\nthe ventilator, had two episodes of cardiac arrest separated by\ndays, and was unable to be resuscitated from the second, see\nbelow.\n.\n# Shock:  The patient had bandemia of 41%, fever, tachypnea, and\nelevated lactate\non admission with evidence of a pulmonary source on CXR, however\nblood cultures were not drawn on admission.  Other sources\nconsidered were endocarditis, osteomyelitis, pancreatitis, and\nother intra-abdominal process, however pneumonia was thought to\nbe the source after thorough evaluation of other possibilities.\nAfter intubation the patient experienced hypotension, requiring\naggressive volume resuscitation and ultimately the use of\npressors.  Over the course of his hospitalization, the patient\nrequired the use of pressors, at times multiple pressors, to\nmaintain adequate blood pressure.  Multiple cultures were sent\nfrom sputum, blood, urine, pleural fluid, BALs however all\nfollowing the administration of IV antibiotics and all found to\nbe negative.  The patient was initially started on levofloxacin,\nvancomycin and zosyn for broad antibiotic coverage.  After ID\nconsultation, the patient was started on clindamycin for\npossible toxin mediated process given the rapidity of the\nprogression.  The patient continued to require pressors, renal\nfunction continued to worsen, and continued to spike fevers.\n      On [**2139-12-26**] at 4:30am the patient underwent a run of\npulseless polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.  Chest\ncompressions were started, he was shocked once and spontaneous\ncirculation returned.  At that time, his electrolytes were\nwithin normal limits.  He was started on an amiodarone drip.\nCardiology was consulted, and thought that the arrhythmia was\nsecondary to his metabolic derrangement.  Cardiology recommended\ncontinuing oral amiodarone.  The patient recovered from the code\nand was thought to be improving.  He was tolerating lasix for\nvolume removal and eventually weaned off of pressors for\nintermittent periods.  However, on [**2139-12-31**] the patient coded\nagain, initally started as hypotension, then progressed to\nbradycardia and eventually PEA.  The patient was given atropine\nand vasopression.  Defibrillation was attempted with no return\nof spontaneous circulation.  He was given calcium and magnesium.\n His bedside US did not show evidence of a pericardial effusion,\nhis labs were unremarkable.  The patient was pronounced dead\nafter 40min of resuscitation without spontaneous return of\ncirculation.\n.\n# Acute renal failure:  ATN from septic shock.  Renal was\nconsulted.  CVVH line was placed, CVVH started.  Volume was\nremoved by CVVH.  Renal function did not return to normal, the\npatient was unable to be taken off CVVH.\n.\n# Transaminitis:  Secondary to shock liver/hepatic congestion\nafter excluding other possible sources.  Hepatitis serologies\nwere negative.  Abdominal US unremarkable, aside from distended\ngall bladder, which IR declined to drain given no other signs of\ncholecystitis or cholelithiasis.\n.\n# Back pain:  R-sided, was tender to palpation over R mid-back.\nPer his wife he had had some intermittent scapular pain for the\npast 4 months.  Most likely this pain was the only symptom he\nhad of the developing pneumonia.\n.\n# Hypothyroid: TSH was elevated at 14. The patient was treated\nwith levothyroxine 50 mcg IV daily.\n.\n# Thrombocytopenia: Thought to be related to bone marrow\nsuppression secondary to overwhelming sepsis.  Heme/Onc was\nconsulted, agreed with above.  Eventually the thrombocytopenia\ndeveloped into a thrombocytosis likely secondary to infection as\nwell.\n.\n# Conjunctival edema: likely from volume overload.\nOphthalmology consulted and recommended diuresis and lacrilube\nointment applied to the eyes.\n.\n# FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, tube feeds\n.\n# Prophylaxis: pneumoboots\n.\n# Access: RIJ placed [**12-15**], R femoral art line placed [**12-17**]\n\nMedications on Admission:\nLevothyroxine 100 mcg daily\nLisinopril 5 mg daily\nASA 325mg daily\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\nN/A\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nUnderlying diagnosis unknown at time of death, sepsis of unknown\ncause\n\nDischarge Condition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nN/A\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nN/A\n\n                             [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Name8 (MD) **] MD [**MD Number(1) 292**]\n\nCompleted by:[**2140-1-12**]"
