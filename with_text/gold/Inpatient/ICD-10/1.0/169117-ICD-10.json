Right colectomy.\n2. Extensive enterolysis.\n3. Exploratory laparotomy.\n4. Washout and takedown and resection of failed ileocolic\n    anastomosis with end ileostomy.\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\nThis patient is a 79-year-old male who presents with a history\nof having anemia which was worked up and he was found to have a\ntumor in cecum very near the ileocecal valve. This was palpable\nat the time surgery. Additionally he\nhad 2  polyps in the ascending colon. The highest one was distal\nto the hepatic flexure. At surgery we found his hepatic flexure\nwas quite adherent to the gallbladder fossa. This was taken down\nand we managed to get his colon over to\nthe level of his antecolic B2 where we resected. We actually\nmanaged to get to the right branch of the middle colic artery.\nThis did require extensive enterolysis for approximately an hour\nand half because of his previous\nabdominal sepsis following coronary artery bypass graft in [**2093**].\n\nHe was doing well until yesterday when he developed a white\ncount and a fever overnight. This morning he had some stool\nexpressing from his wound. He was\nbrought to surgery and there he was found to have fecal\nperitonitis. He actually been taking diet and having flatus, but\nno bowel movement yet prior to surgery. At surgery, the colonic\nside of this ileocolic anastomoses was found to be disrupted,\nbut was not necrotic. It was determined that the entire colon\nwas open, and so therefore, it was felt it would probably be\nbest to just go ahead and oversew it and take down the\nanastomoses and give him an end ileostomy, especially since\nthere was so much a fecal spillage. This was\naccomplished with some degree of difficulty because he had had a\npreperitoneal bleed, I assume from closure, so we had some\nabdominal wall hematoma, as well, which was removed.\n\nPast Medical History:\nCAD s/p CABG [**2093**]\nAntrectomy and vagotomy [**2093**] with BillrothII then converted to\nR-Y\nGERD\nHTN\n\nSocial History:\nLives at home with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] social support amongst family\nmembers.\n\nFamily History:\nNot elicited\n\nPertinent Results:\n[**2106-11-19**] 06:01PM   POTASSIUM-4.1\n[**2106-11-19**] 06:01PM   CK(CPK)-377*\n[**2106-11-19**] 06:01PM   CK-MB-5 cTropnT-<0.01\n[**2106-11-19**] 06:01PM   MAGNESIUM-1.5*\n[**2106-11-19**] 06:01PM   HCT-39.0*\n[**2106-11-19**] 05:09PM   HGB-13.2* calcHCT-40\n[**2106-11-19**] 04:24PM   HGB-5.7* calcHCT-17\n\nPORTABLE CHEST, [**2106-11-19**], 21:44\n\nINDICATION: Hypertension and dyspnea.\n\nFINDINGS:\n\nCABG changes are evident. At the right upper lobe laterally,\nthere is some\nlinear reticular markings and a nodular feature is appreciated\nprojecting over\nright anterior rib 3. The latter was shown to be a dense\ncalcification on\nprior chest CT. That CT shows no definite correlate with the\nreticular\nmarkings visualized at the right upper lobe laterally, but\nadditional\nreticular markings were seen in the right upper lobe anteriorly.\nThe\npulmonary vascular markings are not distended, and the\ncostophrenic sulci are\nsharply delineated. There is no focal consolidation. No\npneumothorax.\n\nIMPRESSION: No focal consolidation. Reticular markings seen in\nthe right\nupper lobe laterally should be followed with a subsequent film\nto see if this\nis evolving. Dense calcification presumably granuloma in the\nsuperior aspect\nof the right lower lobe laterally.\n\nPathology Report\nSPECIMEN SUBMITTED: right colon.\n\nProcedure date     Tissue received     Report Date    Diagnosed\nby\n[**2106-11-19**] [**2106-11-19**] [**2106-11-23**] DR.

Adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon, see synoptic report.\n2.  Two adenomas of the colon.\n3.  Fibrous obliteration, distal end of appendix.\n4.  Ileal segment, within normal limits.\n\nECG\nSinus rhythm with borderline A-V conduction delay\nConsider left atrial abnormality\nLeft anterior fascicular block\nSince previous tracing of [**2106-11-16**], ventricular ectopy absent\n\n\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nPt admitted to surgery for removal of adenocarcinoma proximal\ncolon. He had a colectomy of the R colon and an anastomis\nperformed to bring terminal ileum to the transverse colon.  This\ndid require extensive enterolysis for approximately an hour and\nhalf because of his previous abdominal sepsis following coronary\nartery bypass graft in [**2093**].  He did well for the first five\npostoperative days until it was noted on POD 6 that pt had stool\nexpressing from his wound. He was brought to surgery and there\nhe was found to have fecal peritonitis. He was on a regular diet\nand having flatus, but no bowel movement yet prior to the second\nsurgery. At surgery, the colonic side of this ileocolic\nanastomoses was found to be disrupted, but was not necrotic. It\nwas determined that the entire colon was open, and so therefore,\nit was felt it would probably be best to just go ahead and\noversew it and take down the anastomoses and give him an end\nileostomy, especially since there was so much a fecal spillage.\nThis was accomplished with some degree of difficulty because he\nhad had a preperitoneal bleed, I assume from closure, so we had\nsome abdominal wall hematoma, as well, which was removed.  S/p\nsurgery pt did well and had wound vac placed over abdominal wall\nwhere hematoma was removed.  Pt continued to progress and was\ndischarged to home after receinf ileostomy care and setting up\nservices for wound vac changes.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nAtenolol 50mg Qdaily\nXanax 0.25 PRN\nOmeprazole 20mg QDaily\nMVN\nASA 81mg QDaily\nTravatan Eye drops (Travoprost)\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
