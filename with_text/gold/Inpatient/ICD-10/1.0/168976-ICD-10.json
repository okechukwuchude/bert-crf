Renal transplant\nultrasound was normal except for large subcutaneous fluid\ncollection that was also noted on CT.  On hospital day 1, there\nwas concern for rejection.  She was started on solumedrol 500mg\nIV qday for this concern pending biopsy results.  Renal biopsy\nshowed no signs of rejection, but was consistent with rapidly\nprogressing FSGS. IV solumedrol was decreased from 500 to 100 mg\nqday on day 3 then ultimately switched to Prednisone 60 mg qday\non day 5--which was continued throughout admission and continued\non discharge.  Studies into the etioogy of the FSGS were\nnegative -- HIV negative, BK virius negative, ANCA negative,\ncompliment levels normal, Hepatitis serology negative, [**Doctor First Name **] 1:40,\nparvo b19 and HTLV negative. Urine output was monitored as best\nas possible, however patient was non-compliant with collection.\n UA with no signs of urinary tract infection.  On hospital day\n3, plasmapheresis was empirically initiated.  During her\nplasmapheresis courses, calcium levels were noted to be low and\nwere repleted on an as needed basis.  She received 4 sessions of\nplasmapheresis, however due to development of fever and signs of\ninfection on hospital day 10 this was not continued.  Urine\nProtein/Creatinine ratio was monitored on a daily basis during\nthe initial part of admission peaking at 30.7 then trending down\nto 1.7 after 2 weeks.  Throughout admission, hemodialysis was\ndone on as needed basis with one 9-day period of no\nhemodialysis.  Patient will continue dialysis as outpatient, as\nwell as prednisone and tacrolimus.  She should follow up with\nTransplant nephrology as arranged.  Should continue tacrolimus\nwith goal trough [**5-5**].  Dose was decreased to 4mg [**Hospital1 **] on day of\ndischarge for elevated trough 9.1.  Please contact transplant\nnephrology at [**Hospital1 18**] for dose adjustments.  Please check tacro\nlevels on Thursday, [**2149-8-28**], and regularly there after.\nShe should continue prednisone at 60mg daily for now.  She\nshould remain on GI prophylaxis, Ca/Vit D as ordered.  Patient\nshould be considered for starting dapsone for PCP prophylaxis in\nthe future rather than atovaquone, but given h/o severe bactrim\nallergy did not challenge with dapsone on this hospitalization.\nG6PD testing was negative.\n-Please send all lab work to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**]-\n.\n# Hemodialysis: Patient to receive T/Th/Sa dialysis as\noutpatient.  At dialysis, she should receive epogen.  In\naddition, she should have PTH, Vitamin D and Iron studies drawn\nat dialysis. She should continue cinacalcet as outpatient and\nvitamin D as follows (50,000 units weekly x 8 weeks, followed by\n1000 units daily thereafter until replete.).  Patient has a slot\nat [**Hospital4 117**] [**Hospital5 **] [**Hospital6 **] after she leaves rehab.\n.\n# C. difficile infection - On day 10 of admission, patient was\nnoted to be febrile.  Patient was also complaining of LLQ\nabdominal pain, but no other associated symptoms.  At this time\npatient was started empirically on cefepime and flagyl for\nsuspected diverticulitis given findings of sigmoid colon wall\nthickening on CT Abdomen and pelvis.  Blood and urine cultures\nwere drawn and negative.  UA negative for UTI.  CXR had no\ninterval change of right basalar atelectasis and patient was\nasymptommatic.  Patient continued to have fevers and vancomycin\nadded on hospital day 12.  Additionally valgancyclovir and\natovoqoune were added at this time for prophylaxis while on high\ndose steroids.  Patient continued to be febrile and complained\nof diarrhea, ID consult felt symptoms were most consistent for\nC. Difficile (had recieved one dose of ceftazadime on\nadmission).  Adenovirus PCT, Toxo serology and stool O&P were\nnegative.  Stool was positive for C. Diff and po vancomycin\nstarted.  Cefepime, flagyl and vancomycin were discontinued.\nPatient had 2 more fevers over the first 48 hours of PO\nvancomycin treatment then was afebrile.  Of note, diarrhea\nwork-up was positive for CMV viral load in blood possibly\nconsistent with CMV colitis (see below). Patient should complete\na 14 day course of PO vancomycin to end on [**2149-9-2**].\n.\n# CMV viremia - patient had detectable CMV viral load during\ndiarrheal work-up.  At the time of detection, patient had been\non valgancyclovir prophylaxis for 4 days.  Initially, it was\nfelt to be viremia w/o end organ involvement, however due to\ncontinued diarrhea on PO vancomycin for C. difficile infection,\ntreatment was changed from valgancyclovir to gancyclovir for\ntreatment of possible CMV disease.  She should be continued on\nIV ganciclovir for treatment of CMV viremia until she has 2\nnegative CMV viral loads separated by one week.  (viral load\n[**8-20**] 861, repeat viral load [**8-25**] pending).\n.\n# Hyperkalemia: Mrs. [**Known lastname 6357**] was diagnosed with elevated\npotassium on admission to the ED.  She had mild peaked T waves\nin V2. In the ED, she received 2 rounds of calcium, insulin and\nwas transferred to the ICU where medical management for\nhyperkalemia was more effective, but she still required emergent\ndialysis.  After a short course of emergent dialysis there was\nimprovement in her electrolytes. Potassium was monitored closely\nthroughout her admission while she underwent intermittant\nhemodialysis.\n.\n\n# Atrial fibrillation: Mrs. [**Known lastname 6357**] went into atrial\nfibrillation with RVR on the  evening of [**8-4**] after dialysis.\nShe had no prior history. Had some chest pain during episode and\nwas ruled out. The atrial fibrillation was converted with\nmetoprolol then Diltiazem IV and she had no further episodes on\ntelemetry.  She was continued on metoprolol for rate control and\nhypertension.  Hydralazine was discontinued.  Echo showed a\nmildly dilated left atrium and LVEH > 55%.  TSH was WNL.  After\none week, telemetry was discontinued.\n.\n# Hypertension: Mrs. [**Known lastname 6357**] was not previously on\nanti-hypertensives prior to admission.  On admission, she was\nnoted to be hypertensive and started on hydralazine and\namlodipine.  After her episode of atrial fibrillation, she was\nalso on hydralazine.  Hydralazine ws discontinued after 2 days\nwith good blood pressure control on metoprolol and amlodipine.\nBlood pressure was monitored and stable throughout her hospital\ncourse with some episodes of hypotension during dialysis.\nAmlodipine was changed to be dosed after dialysis and metoprolol\nreduced to 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].  At discharge, amlodipine was\ndiscontinued due to its tendency to cause lower extremity edema,\nand b/c hypotension had limited her HD sessions.  Metoprolol\nshould be continued and titrated up as needed for hypertension.\n.\n# SLE: stable; on prednisone for FSGS.\n.\n# Anemia - continued iron supplement, epogen with HD as above,\ntransfusions as needed.\n.\n# Access: PICC line in place.  AV fistula functional for now,\nbut had difficulty during hospital stay.\n.\n# Diabetes: presented during hospital stay while on treatment\nwith high dose steroids.  Was covered with glargine qhs, and\nhumalog sliding scale with meals.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nTacro 12mg [**Hospital1 **]\nepo\niron\nVitamin D\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Diff Colitis\nCMV Viremia\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nStable, AOx3, appropriate.\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nYou were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of kidney\nfailure.  You had a biopsy of your kidney that showed a reaction\nknown as FSGS or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.  This was\ntreated with high doses of steroids, and plasmapheresis.  You\nhad some mild improvement in your kidney function but required\ndialysis to replace your kidneys.  You will need to continue on\ndialysis until your kidney function improves.  During your\nhospital stay you also developed an infectious diarrhea known as\nC. Diff.  This diarrhea is treated with oral antibiotics such as\nvancomycin.  You were also treated for CMV infection which\noccurs in patients on high doses of immunosuppression such as\nyourself.  Please continue to take all medications on discharge.\n.\nPlease return to the hospital should you experience any fevers,\nchills, night sweats, worsening diarrhea, or other symptoms\nconcerning to you.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nProvider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4861**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**]\nDate/Time:[**2149-9-1**] 1:30\nProvider: [**Name10 (NameIs) 2105**] [**Name11 (NameIs) 2106**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**]\nDate/Time:[**2149-9-22**] 1:20\n\n\n                             [**Name6 (MD) 2105**] [**Name8 (MD) 2106**] MD [**MD Number(2) 5038**]\n\n"
