She was given an insulin gtt at 3U/hr and D5\n1/2NS at 150/hr. Her gap closed by the evening of her admission\nand her glucose remained between 100-150. She ate dinner and was\ngiven 12U NPH overnight, overlapped with the insulin gtt. Her\ngap remained closed through the night and she was given her home\nlantus dose of 34U the morning after admission. She was seen by\nthe [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes fellow who recommended continuation of her\nusual home regimen. She has a follow-up appointment with Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) **] of [**Hospital 18**] [**Hospital3 **] on Tuesday, [**9-2**]\nto follow up with her diabetes management and general health\nneeds.  He will be able to arrange a referral to [**Last Name (un) **] for\nfurther diabetes care if necessary.\n\n#)Healthcare access: Reason for patient's presentation stems\nfrom her recent job loss and a change in her health insurance.\nHer previous endocrinologist and PCP apparently do not accept\nher new insurance now that she is unemployed.  Social work was\nconsulted who discussed patient's options under her new health\ninsurance.  She was advised that [**Hospital1 18**] PCP's would accept her\nnew insurance, and likely that [**Last Name (un) **] would as well.  Patient\nwas established with a PCP at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Name9 (PRE) 191**] and told to contact the\n[**Name (NI) **] clinic for further diabetes care upon discharge.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n\n#)Depression/Anxiety: stable, patient was continued on home\nmedication regimen.  Further management as per new PCP.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n\nPatient has been established with new PCP at [**Hospital1 18**] who can\narrange for referral to [**Hospital **] clinic for diabetes management if\nnecessary.  Social work remains available at [**Hospital1 18**] should she\nhave further access issues in the future.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nAlbuterol Inhaler 1 PUFF IH Q4H:PRN wheezing/sob\nDiazepam 5 mg PO BID:PRN anxiety, insomnia\nLaMOTrigine 75 mg PO DAILY\nQuetiapine Fumarate 50 mg PO HS\nGlargine 34 Units Breakfast\nInsulin SC Sliding Scale using HUM Insulin\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
