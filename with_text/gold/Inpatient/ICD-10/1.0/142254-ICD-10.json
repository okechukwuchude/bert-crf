A chest CT was done and revealed a right pleural\neffusion.  No pulmonary embolism was noted. On [**2139-7-28**]\ninterventional pulmonary was consulted.  They recommended a\npleuroscopy with pleur ex catheter placement. Her Lovenox was\nheld. On [**2139-7-30**] she underwent Rigid fluoroscopy.Right pleural\nbiopsies. Talc pleurodesis. Insertion of a 24-French right chest\ntube. Insertion of a right PleureX catheter. A total of 1400 mL\nof bloody fluid was aspirated.  She was transferred to the PACU\nand found to be hypotensive with blood pressure in the 70s/40s.\nDespite 3L IVF boluses she continued to be hypotensive and was\ntransferred to the SICU.  On [**2139-7-31**] she was tachycardia to the\n130s despite IVF, episode of anxiety/desaturation with\nincreasing O2 requirements.
