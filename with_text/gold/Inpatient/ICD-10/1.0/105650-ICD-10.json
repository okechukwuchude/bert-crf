No fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine.\n2. Posterior osteophytes at C5-6 and C6-7 contact the thecal\nsac. MRI is\nmore sensitive for evaluation of the thecal sac and its\ncontents.\n\nHead CT [**3-29**]:\nTECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the\nbrain. No\ncontrast was administered. Multiplanar reformatted images were\ngenerated.\nFINDINGS: Hyperdense material is seen within the subdural space\noverlying the left frontoparietal cortex. This acute left\nsubdural hemorrhage has increased slightly in extent compared to\nthe prior CT. Hemorrhage measures\napproximately 5 mm in depth, and now extends slightly further\nposteriorly, now overlying the left parietal cortex (2:19).\nInferiorly in the right frontal lobe, there is a small focus of\nhyperdense material, likely reflecting a hemorrhagic contusion.\nThis spans a region of less than 1 cm, and is largely unchanged\nfrom the prior CT. There are no other foci of intracranial\nhemorrhage. There is no edema, shift of normally midline\nstructures or evidence of major vascular territorial infarct.\nAdjacent to the left subdural hematoma, sulci are not effaced\nand there is no mass effect. Ventricles and sulci are normal in\nsize and configuration. The basilar cisterns are patent. The\n[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation is preserved.\nThere is no fracture. Paranasal sinuses demonstrate complete\nopacification of the right maxillary sinus with low-density\nmaterial, as well as erosion of the medial wall of the right\nmaxillary sinus with opacification of the adjacent nasal cavity\nand neighboring right ethmoid air cells. The sphenoid and\nmastoid air cells are well aerated. The frontal sinuses are only\nminimally pneumatized, with a small amount of soft tissue\nmaterial extending anteriorly from the right ethmoid air cells.\nSoft tissues reveal a small scalp hematoma overlying the right\ninferior frontal bone just above the orbit.\nIMPRESSIONS:\n1. Left frontoparietal subdural hematoma, slightly increased in\nsize compared to the prior study of approximately three hours\nearlier. No underlying sulcal effacement or mass effect. No\nherniation.\n2. Small hemorrhagic contusion of the right inferior frontal\nlobe, unchanged from the prior exam.\n3. No fractures.\n4. Small scalp hematoma overlying right inferior frontal bone.\n5. Severe sinus disease, with complete opacification of the\nright maxillary\nsinus and erosion of right maxillary sinus medial wall.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient was admitted on [**3-29**] following a fall while\nintoxicated, striking her head. She was admitted to the ICU for\n24 hour monitoring. On [**3-30**], after an uneventful night, she was\ntransferred to the neurosurgery floor.  Head CT done prior to\ntransfer showed stable intracranial contusions. She was\nevaluated by physical and occupational therapy who determined\nthat she was physically safe for discharge to home. Psychiatry\nwas consulted who recommended Haldol PRN while in the hospital\nand they agreed with the CIWA scale. Social work was also\nconsulted to assess home safety and patient coping. The patient\nexpressed interest in attempting to quit drinking. Social work\ngave her some resources to use for when she goes home. The\npatient was discharged home on [**2161-4-1**].\n\nMedications on Admission:\nVicodin prn\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. Phenytoin Sodium Extended 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule\nPO TID (3 times a day) for 7 days.\nDisp:*21 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*\n2. Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6\nhours) as needed.\n3.

Counseling\nWe recommend that you seek outpatient counseling for\ndiscontiuing alcohol use.\n\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nHome\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nBifrontal contusions,Right frontal Intraparenchymal hemorrhage,\nLeft frontal Subdural hemorrhage.\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nNeurologically Stable\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nGeneral Instructions\n\n??????\tTake your pain medicine as prescribed.\n??????\tExercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining,\nor excessive bending.\n??????\tIncrease your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain\nmedicine can cause constipation. We generally recommend taking\nan over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace)\nwhile taking narcotic pain medication.\n??????\tUnless directed by your doctor, do not take any\nanti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, or\nIbuprofen etc.\n\nCALL YOUR SURGEON IMMEDIATELY IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY OF THE\nFOLLOWING\n\n??????\tNew onset of tremors or seizures.\n??????\tAny confusion, lethargy or change in mental status.\n??????\tAny numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.\n??????\tPain or headache that is continually increasing, or not\nrelieved by pain medication.\n??????\tNew onset of the loss of function, or decrease of function on\none whole side of your body.\n\n\nFollowup Instructions:\n??????Please call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 88**] to schedule an appointment with Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) **], to be seen in 4 weeks.\n??????You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast prior to\nyour appointment.
