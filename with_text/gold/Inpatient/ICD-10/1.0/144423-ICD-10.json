Persistent bibasilar atelectasis,\nminimally\nimproved at the left lung base, with associated persistent\nmoderate elevation of left hemidiaphragm and either a small left\npleural effusion or pleural thickening. Known right rib\nfractures are again visualized.\n.\nRadiology Report BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2155-10-13**]\n3:59 PM\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No right lower extremity DVT.\n2. No DVT in the left common femoral, superficial femoral, or\npopliteal vein.\nNonvisualization of left calf veins secondary to bandage\nmaterial.\n.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr [**Known lastname 24927**] was admitted [**2155-10-6**] after suffering a motorcycle\ncollision vs tree while riding his bike unhelmeted. He suffered\nthe following injuries: open comminuted L tib-fib fracture, R\nptx, R scapular fx, and bilateral rib fx (right [**3-4**] and left 1st\nrib. He was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] ACS service on [**2155-10-6**].\n\nTwo chest tubes were placed in the emergency room and one was\ntaken out shortly after because of incorrect placement. There\nwas a concern for tension pneumothorax with complete collapse of\nthe right lung shown on CT-scan; during scanning, the patient\ndeveloped shortness of breath with O2sats in high 80s, and was\nbrought back to the trauma bay for stabilization whereupon he\nunderwent a second chest tube placement on the right. A repeat\nportable CXR was obtained, which demonstrated no improvement.\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) 853**], trauma surgery attending, was able to re-place the\nfirst chest tube with relief in the patient's symptoms with\nmaintenance of stable O2sats in the high 90s. His remaining CT\nscans were then performed, which demonstrated the above\ninjuries, with no visceral injuries. He was concomitantly\nevaluated by Orthopedics for his left open tibia-fibular\nfracture, his wound was irrigated, and the leg splinted. He\nreceived gentamicin, a tetanus shot and ancef at this time.\n\nHe was then taken emergently to the operating room by the\northopedic surgery service for irrigation and debridement of\nleft tibia open fracture, application of external fixator,\nclosed reduction left tibia and fibula fracture and placement of\nVAC dressing, and was then tranferred to the ICU for further\ncare.\n\nAfter extubation, the patient noted right foot pain, with\noriginal CT scans demonstrating a questionable fracture. Right\nfoot films on [**2155-10-9**] showed fractures of metatarsals [**1-31**]\nwith a question of fracture of the base of the lisfranc\nligament. Orthopedics was notified of this finding, with further\nmanagement by their service. Plastics/Reconstructive Surgery was\nalso consulted intra-operatively for a possible washout and flap\nfor his left lower extremity wound: reader is referred to both\northopedics and plastics summaries on respective management.\n\nNeuro: pain control was obtained with a dilaudid PCA\nsupplemented by a lidocaine patch and MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] in the early\npostoperative period. He was transferred to the floor soon after\nORIF of the left tibia-fibular fracture and was managed with\nmorphine IR, MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], and morphine IV as well as lidocaine\npatch. He remained neurologically intact throughout.\n\nCVS:the patient remained hemodynamically stable. He was\ncontinued on telemetry on the floor and remained in sinus\nrhythm.\n\nPulm:the R chest tube was kept on suction for 48 hours with good\nlung re-expansion. Incentive spirometry and pulmonary toilet\nwere encouraged. Prior to transfer, he was maintaining O2 sats\nat 93-95% on RA with additional oxygen requirement.\nRecommendations were made to remove the chest tube after washout\nwith the Plastics service on [**2155-10-10**].\n\nGI/FEN: the patient was kept on a regular diet, which he\ntolerated well.\n\nGU: a foley catheter was initially placed for UOP monitoring and\nwas further managed by the plastics service when he was\ntransferred on [**2155-10-10**]\n\nHeme: Hct were trended daily and dropped to 21 at midnight on\n[**10-9**]. He was transfused 2u pRBCs and his hct has remained\nstable since.\n\nID: Ancef/Gent were administered for 3 days for empiric coverage\ngiven open tib/fib fracture per orthopedics. He is currently on\ncefazolin per ortho.\n\nProphylaxis:\nDVT: boots and enoxaparin were employed daily\nStress ulcer: PO famotidine was administered\n.\nOn [**2155-10-10**], the patient was admitted to the Plastic and\nReconstructive Surgery service status post left lower extremity\ndebridement and wound vac placement in preparation for planned\nfree flap to left lower extremity defect.  Post-procedure, the\nright chest tube was discontinued and patient had multiple\nsurveillance chest xrays indicating the resolution of the right\npneumothorax but the post-procedureal development of bibasilar\nareas of atelectasis.  Patient was encouraged to get out of bed\nto chair for extended periods and to use his incentive\nspirometer frequently.  He was utilizing albuterol and atrovent\nnebulizer treatments around the clock.\n.\nOn [**2155-10-15**], the patient returned to the OR for a free flap to\nhis left lower extremity defect. When wound VAC dressing was\nremoved, the left lower extremity about the wound site appeared\nvery unstable;particularly, the proximal fragment was not being\nwell-supported by the nail and was very mobile causing\ndeformity. Ortho service was called and came to washout the\nwound, plate the fracture and replace the cement spacer.  Once\nthis was complete, the Plastic service proceeded with\nreconstruction of the LLE utilizing a left ALT flap.  The\npatient tolerated the procedure well and stayed overnight in the\nPost Anesthesia Care Unit for hourly 'flap checks'.\n.\nNeuro: Post-operatively, the patient received a Morphine PCA for\nbreakthrough pain in addition to his standing MS Contin 30mg PO\nQ12h with good effect and adequate pain control.

Intake and output were closely monitored.\n.\nID: The patient was maintained on IV cefazolin every 8 hours.\nThe patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of\ninfection.\n.\nProphylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin\npost-operatively. Patient was given 121.5 mg of aspirin, daily,\nto maintain the vascular integrity of the flap.  In addition,\npatient was placed on a Kinair bed for the post-operative period\nof mandatory bedrest to protect skin integrity.  A pneumoboot\nwas placed on the RLE at all times while patient in bed.\n.\nAt the time of discharge on [**10-24**], the patient was doing well,\nafebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet,\nambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well\ncontrolled.\n\nMedications on Admission:\ntramadol prn\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
