EGD at\nthat hospital was described with findings of gastritis,\nduodenitis and coffee grounds.The patient was started on twice\ndaily proton pump inhibitor. She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]\nMICU where she had serial Hct's that were stable. Bleeding scan\ndid not reveal a source of bleeding. GI consult team followed\nthe patient. Endoscopy was attempted and failed due to patient\nbeing unable to tolerate the procedure. Colonoscopy was\ncompleted and revealed diverticulosis of the ascending and\nsigmoid colon with a polyp in the region of the hepatic flexure\nand no identifiable source of bleeding. It is possible that this\nrepresented divertular bleeding though another explanation\ncannot be excluded. Her stooling changed to brown. The patient\nwas discharged on once daily proton pump inhibitor (lansoprazole\nas patient requires meds that can be crushed). She requires\nrepeat Hct check weekly and these results should be discussed\nwith a doctor if the value is less than 25. She was counselled\nto be seen as an outpatient by gastroenterology for\nconsideration of capsule endoscopy. For recurrent bleeding, the\npatient should undergo repeat bleeding scan. On admission, the\npatient's home aggrenox, beta-blocker and diuretic were held.\nThese should not be restarted until the patient discusses\nrestarting these with her primary care doctor. Aggrenox should\nbe held for a minimum of 2 weeks.\n\nThe patient had poorly controlled hypertension on admission to\nthe OSH. She was restarted on her home medications including\nACEI with good effect. Her home beta-blocker and diuretic was\nheld in the setting of acute bleeding.\n\nRenal insufficiency. Cr was at or below baseline throughout\nadmission.\n\nDiabetes. The patient had hypoglycemia on a diabetic diet. Her\nhome glucotrol should be held. She should have twice daily\nfingerstick glucose and this can be restarted for any 2 or more\nconsecutive values >150.\n\nCAD s/p CABG. The patient continued on ACEi and statin\nthroughout her hospitalization. Aggrenox and beta-blocker were\nheld in the setting of acute bleeding as described above.\n\nHistory of TIA. As above, aggrenox was held.\n\nDepression/anxiety/dementia. Continued home celexa and aricept.\n\nCODE. While in the ICU, the medical team discussed goals of care\nwith the patient and her family.

She initially presented to [**Location (un) 196**] on [**11-24**]\n   with dark maroon stools. She was admitted to the ICU and GI was\n   consulted. An EGD was performed which showed no evidence of active\n   bleeding but did show a hiatal hernia. Slightly irregular mucosa was\n   also noted at the SC juntion; coffee grounds were also noted in the\n   stomach with 1+ duodenitis. Initial Hb 8 -> 3 units PRBCs -> Hb 10.\n   However, she has had recurrent episodes of rectal bleeding, now with\n   bright red blood.  Hb 10 -> 8 after multiple episodes of bloody stools.\n   She has denied chest pain, SOB, lightheadedness, nausea, or abdominal\n   pain throughout her admission.  She has remained hemodynamically stable\n   throughout.  Her most recent vitals prior to transfer, she was\n   afebrile, 141/46, 62, 18 98% RA.  She has 1 18G PIV and 1 20G PIV at\n   time of transfer. In the ambulance, BPs ranged 120s-170s systolic. Her\n   2nd U PRBCs was hanging on transfer.\n   .\n   On arrival to the ICU, the patient was evaluated by the surgical\n   consult team. She complains of right shoulder pain.
